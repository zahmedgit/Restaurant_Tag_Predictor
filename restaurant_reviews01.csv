There's a self service bar towards the back where they have a lot of nicely displayed entrees for your picking. YES YOU CAN GET UNLIMITED AMOUNTS OF THESE. They also have several servers walking around the dining area with sticks of meat ready to serve if you desire. You get a little wooden block with green for more and red for stop. They alternate between wings, steak cuts, briskets, cinnamon pineapples, and other delicious fancies. They also serve a full bar to the table with a lot of fancy cocktails.  The host and servers we're all extremely friendly and explained the meats they we're serving with the option of medium well, to medium-rare. The price is 40$ per person and it's an AYCE type of deal. If you have been meat deprived like me, this place will do wonders for you!"

It was $44.95 per person. I read some decent reviews so I decided to give it a try. The buffet where you can physically get up and grab food are all sides made with inexpensive ingredients and are very limited. For example, they offered plantains used for tostones and steamed potatoes. I liked the tostones but they really should offer gourmet dishes at a churrascaria. When the rodizio comes around, you only get a small portion of food (about a bite-sized portion per person or table per turn -- refer to attached photo for accurate portion sizes (one single sausage the size of an average man's big toe for the table (there's 2 of us) and about two pieces of lechón each) and honestly not a lot of options of meat to choose from. The only type of steak they have is from a rough cut of meat that's worse than flank or skirt steak. The only meat I actually enjoyed was the lechón - roast pork. They give you a small double-sided place card you can leave at your table to indicate if you would like more meat but they don't come around your table as frequent as you'd like them to - they have a timed system of making their way around the dining area. You can only dine for 90 minutes which was fine with me since that's the norm with most decent restaurants but you honestly pay $45 for just about $8 worth of meat and sides. I enjoyed the pork and friendliness of the staff but the lack of options and diversity in the restaurant and the continual waiting between turns just to get tiny portions of meat made my experience less than magical. The $45 we paid was holiday price so normally it probably would be less. It was an okay experience and I'm glad I got to try it but I wouldn't recommend. Sticking to Fogo de Chão in Midtown next time. Breakdown of review:[ FOOD: 2.5/5 ]Steak: 2/5Lechón: 4/5Sausage: 3/5""Buffet"": 1/5[ ATMOSPHERE: 3/5 ]Would I recommend? No. There are way better options in terms of food and flavor all along the stretch of Roosevelt Ave in Jackson Heights and Corona.Would I come back? While I don't entirely regret this trip, I wouldn't just because of the food. The place is great but once is enough.FINAL RATING: 2.75/5"

I returned this evening on a Saturday night with my husband and my in-laws. My first visit had been on an evening during the week, and we were one of only three tables dining at the restaurant that evening. My experience that evening was much different from it was tonight. The place was full as expected for a weekend, but it was immediately clear that this place does not operate well with a full restaurant. Service was extremely slow - empty glasses were left unfilled unless we flagged down a passing member of the waitstaff. The salad bar food that was delicious during my last visit was bland and flavorless this time around, so I ended up throwing away most of what I picked up. What a shame. It took so long for anyone to come to our table with meat, but the majority of the time when anyone came to our table it was the same offerings - chicken, sausage, and occasionally ribs. Where was the steak? We voiced our concerns twice, once to the gentleman in the suit (the maitre d assume?) and then once to our waitress, who finally got a few steak options sent over to our table. But unfortunately, they all suffered the same issues - they were bland, overcooked, and chewy. No juicy and flavorful meat from my last visit. This was the first visit to this restaurant for my husband and his parents and unfortunately, they were so appalled by the subpar food and service they will not be returning. Neither will I."

If you can, request for a table near the salad bar or in the main dining area.  We sat just outside of that, by the windows and the cocktail Bar.  This is also where the TVs are at.  While dining, I saw most of the servers with their meat skewers on display walking around the main dining area first so by the time it made it over to us, there was a lot of meat gone.We also noticed the variety of meat that was being paraded around was the basically chicken, sirloin, or pork ribs.  So, we took note with the waitress and started ordering on demand - which worked out way better.  Duck was not available (we asked), though it is advertised. We ended up requesting quail, Lamb, and cheese bread. Not quite the fresh pan Con queso but it'll do. Bite sized cheese bread is always a win.The bacon wrapped anything was delicious. The quail was really good too but a bit on the small side. Best thing actually was the grilled pineapple and the medium rare steak. My group and I had a fun evening nonetheless once we go to dessert. They had chocolate cake, tiramisu, passion fruit mousse, cheesecake and red velvet cake. There may have been one or two more but I can't seem to recall now.BTW, the salad bar does have meat entrees in it so if you're not a big eater, it could be a good option. Pasta with meatballs was available, fries, chicken nuggets, fish, lots of different salads, and a yummy beef stew type option with potatoes. But alas, I came for the all you can eat meat so I only made one pass at the salad bar. It was just to get my veggies in. LOL So this review was just three stars as some of the meat was only ok. I expected more variety and I didn't like that it was all you can eat only on the meat. For the premium price, it should've included a soft drink or one dessert option. They should just create that option."

When I entered, there are several parties there.There were TVs playing sports and music playing in the background. I was seated right away as it only opens for dinner and it was close to closing. In the salad bar, there were some dishes, salad area, fruits, and jello. There were several cuts of meat coming out.The item that sets this place apart from the other rodizios I have been to is the cinnamon pineapple, which is sweet with its cinnamon fragrance. I will come back."

The place is packed on a Saturday eve with about 10 to 15 mins of wait, not bad. Rainhas is a must among buffets. Great selections of salad, fish, beef, desserts, etc. and the non stop rounds of roasted meats served! Lamb, beef, chicken, pork, sausages. Not to mention the corn and their out of this world roasted pineapple. The servers were friendly, attentive and always smiling. Plus a great dance showcase of ladies dressed in Brazilian costumes! Got home with a happy tummy! I am definitely coming back!"

But if you're in queens, definitely try it out. Luckily we made reservation because this place fills up pretty quick. If you're a meat lover, this is your spot or you can always try out the buffet section. Overall experience 8/10"

Still love it but they needed more staff for an unexpected Tuesday night rush. The hostess was great in not having her feathers ruffled by the amount of ppl she was busy hosting and serving water too as well as picking up dirty dishes from tables who were done. The food selection was good. Wished they had more fruits available but again it was a Tuesday and I've been here on a weekend and your overwhelmed with choices. 4 stars because they were understaff and there appeared to be a manager on hand who wasn't willing to pitch in where needed. Good thing he had the hostess there, as she did an amazing job. This is buffet style which is why we only have desert pics... and all meats are served at your table. For the sake of privacy for the servers I wouldn't post pics of them as they served.. but the meats are the best part of this place, besides the sangria"

Now that is why I go back!!

Though the server forgot to bring us our drinks multiple times, she came back to ask us if we wanted drinks 3x and still never got it, I have decided to look past that because the place was pretty packed when we went there.This is my go to AYCE Brazilian place in queens."

My 1st time coming here. The Meats were amazing! Ate soooo much. Pineapple is OMG, It was had a touch of cinnamon and a delicious glaze. Top sirloin was a big Wow. Beef and chicken bacon Wrapped was Slamming! Servers were friendly, professional and attentive. Definitely A Must Try. I highly recommend this place if you love meat!"

On Saturday night the place was jumping.Free valet parking.Make sure to have a reservation, waits are very long.Its a neighborhood restaurant, and i'm sure people come from other places. The price is alright, with the money you pay, i guess you cannot get better than what it is.Adults $39, kids are half price.With your all you can eat, there is an open buffet for salad bar, and some hot dishes.Our waiter came just once at start, took our drinks order and disappeared. And we got our drinks way after we started our meal. And that was it, never been asked of we want more. Just when finishing, tried to be present.Meat carvers, runners work a lot and very attentive. Especially have to thank Johnny with his amazing service.From the cuts, bbef tenderloin, top sirloin, and skirt steak were my favorite. Don't care too much with chicken, beef shish kebab( too sweet tasting and seasoning not right ). At the end got some pieces of lamb as well, they were to chewy and not edible, so I don't recommend that one as well."

What is not to love?!Unlimited variety of beautifully cooked meats brought to your table for you: check.Nice lively atmosphere: check. Decent selection of drinks: check. Additional hot n cold buffet: check. Entertainment (there was a belly dancer or something while we there unsure if it was for a private party or if the restaurant provided the dancer): check. Prompt, friendly service: check. Lovely place to bring a date or a group of friends  and family.Word of warning though, make sure you come with a big appetite! You'll definitely need it if  you want to try all the different meats they have on offer!"

We weren't impressed. We thought we're not coming back but yesterday I was craving for a good steak, so we came back. This time it was a Friday, and we went dinner. And our first experience that was negative was completely replaced. we thought we weren't coming back but Johnny's VIP treatment to us made us feel so welcomed and special. So we'll def coming back. Food wise, really, really good. My faves are the sirloin, ribeye, and chicharoooon. Ohh the wings too, so so good! Thinking of it makes me salivate lol add the foods that are included in the Hot and cold buffet. Cleanliness, absolutely. There's unisex restroom upstairs and separate restrooms downstairs. Staff courtesy and thoughtfulness, 100% great. They respectfully ask you and not just give you a piece and leave. They are nice, and very patient when I am indecisive if I want more or no. Thank you to our wait staff Tina, and most especially the captain waitstaff, Johnny. We're coming back because of your staff and good food of course!"

Reservation is required for more than 8 ppl. Lots seating, and walk in is welcome.If you are a carnivore, you will love this restaurant. Mediocre salad bar and hot food buffet, which I shouldn't complain when It's only $38.95 a person vs much higher price in other Brazilian steakhouses. We were all so excited when the servers bringing all different kinds of meats to our table. Roasted beef, beef tenderloin, chicken wings, BBQ ribs, sausage, pork loin, roasted corns, and roasted pineapple. All meats were perfectly done and tailored to your taste. You will get to pick rare, medium and well done. Servers check on us throughout the night to ensure we have enough food. My favorite items are the roasted pineapple. Brown sugar cinnamon coated pineapple after roasting brings out the fruit's rich flavor of sweet and sour. It was so good I can't stop eating it. Dessert selections are available at &8.95 a piece. I highly recommend this place for the price and quantity of the meats."

This place isn't anything fancy but you'll definitely get a nice meal for $40 bucks.Naturally we started with the hot buffet and salad bar. They have quite a bit of selections for everyone to choose from. Notably for me the best things were the mashed potatoes w/ gravy, shrimp, the cheesy bread and the salad. Again there are various things for everyone to try even sushi.For the meats everything that we tried in the rotation was good; Lamb, chicken, various different cuts of steak, roast beef, sausage and ribs. Everything was tasty and well flavored. One of the best things that came around in the rotation was their specialty Pineapple Caipirinha which was absolutely delicious. It tasted like grilled pineapple with brown sugar and honey, it was excellent!For dessert I ordered the red velvet cake which looked better than it tasted but it was okay. For a cocktail the waitress recommended the henny ginger mojito. It was definitely something different if you're a henny drinker.Overall the service was very good and honestly you can go dressed as is. I would recommend this spot for groups for sure!"

Good variety for the kids too.We got to see samba dancers, atmosphere and music was good. Bathrooms were clean and non crowded.The place is huge, can seat about 300 and have private areas for events you can reserve. The parking is a bit challenging you must come like 30 mins ahead of your reservation time to park inside or with valet; if its a weekend street parking is almost impossible in the area.Totally recommend and will visit again."

I'm surprised that they don't offer leg of lamb or lamb chop. Buffet bar has many selection but nothing special...Service is attentive. I may give it a 5 stars if dessert and coffee are included in the price. They don't even have an ice cream machine."

Johnny in particular was an incredibly polite and attentive server that helped make our last experience memorable. Johnny was prepared at the drop of a hat to serve us tons of meat.

The meat is very salty. The salad bar is very basic. The service is okay. We waited 10 minutes for the first batch of meats and then it was slow after that. There is basically just different cuts of beef. No shrimp or scallops. The only pork was ribs and they smelled funny. The place was jam packed so maybe it's me. I just was not impressed

Go if you want to do something different. The food is good. It is annoying to be constantly looking out for the foods that you do like and waiting for them to come back with it for some more. Dessert- we ordered the pineapple speciality. Not worth it. It is an extra cost to the buffet.

The food was amazing and the staff was attentive and friendly. The salad bar was huge and we lost count of different meats that came to the table after 13! I want to give a special thanks to Johnny (he was one of the meat slicers) for always making sure our plates were full of the most perfectly cooked meats. You can tell he takes pride in his job and wants to make sure everyone is having the best time possible! I even took a picture of him and my boyfriend to remember the amazing experience. 10/10 would recommend and we'll be going there a lot!"

I was looking for food on date night with the hubby. I was scared about price but honestly it's worth every penny $38.99 for unlimited meats and appetizers.

Yes, please! The meats are brought to you as you seated and you let them know how much you want.  Their roasted pineapple was my favorite.I really enjoyed their service, the staff were very attentive and our waitress made sure we were doing satisfied during the whole dinner.  If you have a group of 8 people or more, then reservations are recommended, the restaurant doesn't take reservations for groups less than 8 people.  I came here at 630pm on a Friday evening and there wasn't a wait at all, but by 730/800pm the restaurant was pretty packed. So I recommend coming on the earlier side if you can.  The food was good, but I wouldn't say it was amazing.  The only thing that was amazing was the service and roasted pineapple.  Some cuts of meat were on the dry side.  I would definitely recommend this place if you really enjoy eating meat.

The cakes looked so good!!The staff was really nice I enjoyed Johnny so friendly & nice and especially our waitress Karla who was so sweet & had an infectious smile & laughter.

Always a good experience. The place is very large and open space.  Great for larger party's. Has good food selection and food come quick even when place is crowded. The pre-cooked food is always very good and love the cheesy bread. The meets were all cooked great and had very good flavor. Lots of different choices. Loved the pineapple. Service for the most part is very good and fast. The waiter would ask if everything was good and if there waS any meets or other foods that we would like to eat.

Came here with my family and it was a disappointment. We were served meat about 4 times and they never came back again. We continuously had to ask the waiter to come. We sat right by the cooking area and our waiter couldn't care less about us. He was friendly in the beginning, but afterwards he didn't even care. However, I also did notice he was awfully friendly with other tables. Needless to say, after paying $150 for dinner, I will not go back there anytime soon."

The unlimited meats dinner is a no brainer. The severs come around very often and are very generous with their portions. After 5/6 rounds of meat I was stuffed. I would highly recommend the chimichurri sauce to pair with your meats. We had Johnny, who is amazing and put us one to the secret sauce. If you are feeling a little full ask for the pineapple, it's absolutely delicious and helps create more space in your tummy to push more meat down. We paired our meal with a 35$ bottle of wine, definitely over priced but still good. There is an unlimited salad and hot bar but we only visited it once. Lastly the come around with a platter of desserts!!! Mostly cakes, but very tasty. We will definitely be back and we'll ask for Johnny!"

Went for a friends birthday and it was so nice. The service was great and the staff was pleasant. Everyone had a smile on their face! They have valet parking. The dinner room is great with a waterfall. Very pretty! Also they have a bar. You pay $40 for a meat rotation as people come to your table with different kinds of meats every few minutes. You get to try all different types of Brazilian meats. As well as a full buffet. They also have this awesome pineapple with like cinnamon on it. Totally worth a try. The sangria was $35 a pitcher as to glass is $10. Beer was about $10 a bottle. Good place to come to for a party with family and friends

The quality of the meat was very disappointed. Salty and cheap cuts. We asked for costilla and they're gave us a boiled nasty cut of something that we couldn't eat, just 3 pieces of garbage. The buffet was a joke. Remind me of something along like cheap buffet like cafeteria. Cheap and unfresh salad.  Hot dishes were not appetizing at all. Cheese bread was a joke ( only if you request) I'm so regret that we went there for my mom birthday.  We won't ever be going back again and I dont recomend this place. The service was ok. We paid $ 300 for 6 peoples just for the grilled pineapple.  To the owner!!!don't be cheap with the meat. If not you should open a sandwich store."

I've been there a few times with my wife and family in the past. There seems to be new owners now that are catering to the masses and they don't really care about quality anymore.

But, ROMERO (one of the people who bring the meat to tables) wow was exceptionally incredible!! Despite how busy it was, he always ensured to provide excellent customer service! He always went above and beyond to bring us cuts of meats that we wanted. He is the definition of a hardworking exceptional server (even though he is not a waiter). Wow, I hope he is there every single day so I can return to enjoy the experience. Overall, today was the best service we've received in all of the times that we've been here!

If you visit, safe your appetite for the brisket and the grilled pineapple which comes out at the very end of the meal. They are far superior to the other meats that come out. I also though the chicken wings and sausage were good but that grilled pineapple is really something else. The salad buffet was okay, I didn't go back for seconds. I though the white rice was a little undercooked and that the beans didn't have an authentic Brazilian flavor. I would probably try a different Churrascaria before returning to this restaurant."

I came here for a bday dinner for a friend of mine. The food in here is superb. They were all well cooked, fresh and tasty. The ones that I liked the most were the Picanhas and the pineapples. Apparently, this place are well known for these two dishes. In terms of service, the waiters/waitresses were all attentive to our needs. Even though my party was made of 27 ppl. Most of our needs were well satisfied. In terms of pricing, I believe pricing is good for the quality and quantity of all you can eat buffet. The food were delish and the amount given was superb.

One member of my party doesn't eat meat and was satisfied with the salad bar selection. Jonathan gave us an enthusiastic greeting. He accommodated a 13 person party and got all of drinks right on the first try. Johnny was definitely our MVP. He made sure we had a chance to try eat cut of meat. If there was anything that we weren't presented he was sure to ask for it and then follow up and bring it to us. The restaurant was very strict about not seating us until the party had arrived in full despite the restaurant's known delay in valet parking. Even then, they were patient and accommodating. They did not rush us out and were great about coordinating a double Birthday celebration. I hope that anyone that visits Rainhas has the pleasure of being helped by Johnny, Chucky and Jonathan. It was a pleasure."

The service was impeccable but the food left a lot to be desired. Our wait staff was great made a lot of jokes and created a friendly environment but the buffet style food was not that great. I understand that we got there with less than two hours to closing but there should be an ample amount of food left. Many things were down to the scraps. The quality of the buffet reminded me of something along the likes of Golden Corral. The meat that came around was great.We at the table  enjoyed that part of the evening. So all in all the staff would get five stars but the food from the buffet would get 1.5

But still service was terrible, meat selection was terrible and the amount of meat going around to our table was poor it was 10-15 minutes between the selections., even when we requested a certain meat it didn't come out.....we noticed a table came and they brought them everything over and over and kept bringing them every variety of meat plus requests, yes got much attention from the waitress and the meat servers.... for years we have been coming every weekend for dinner, but I can't see myself coming back. Too bad it was my favorite dinner spot..."

They came to check on us often, from beginning to end of our whole dinning experience.We were seated next to their drink cellar area, pretty dark corner; all night and only once was I unable to get someone right away. And they insists on doing their job and performing the services required or asked of them. (Prime example of that would be our runner, Jonathan.)Our server: Celeste (Very friendly, patient, and attentive)Runner: Jonathan (I heard often unrecognized, please give this man some well deserved acknowledgements or a raise...He was fantastic)Our Meat guy: Franklin (He was awesome too, you make requests and he'd bring it..Every time.)People that you know that they don't hate their jobs lolFood/Meat section: Briskets, beef ribs, flank steak, skirt steak, beef tenderloin (picanha),  filet mignon wrapped in bacon,  chicken wrapped in bacon, sausages, lamb, caramelized pinapples, plus a hot and cold buffet selection...etc) Other selections by request: quail, duck, chicken heartsNo BYOB and desserts and drinks not included. However, this is an AYCE Brazilian steakhouse with no time limits. $35.95 per person, and after tax and tip, roughly $50 each, not bad.The meat quality isn't the highest of grades, but for the price....It'd make most carnivores happy without a doubt."

As good as I remember and it's been maybe 15 years since I have been back here. The salad bar/buffet was pretty lame for the price of $38.95 per person along with the fact that desserts and drinks are not included. However, if you're like me and are there for the meat and happy with a good Caesar salad then this is the place for you. The meats are seasoned well and brought out at a steady pace and in a variety of doneness. I think I ate my $40 worth of meat and had my meat fix for the month. I left a happy customer and you will too f you can half your body weight in meat!"

I love meat and sadly don't recall any of the beef cuts being memorable. I did however ask for lamb twice because it was cooked to my liking.It might sound crazy but I'd pay the buffet price to eat just the grilled pineapples. No joke!

Weekdays , they don't serve lots of meat. Give u small portion of meat like u just there for meat tasting ! Only weekend is the best to eat in there .

There is a buffet which has all kinds of food. Lots of vegetables for any vegetarians joining a family dinner. The only issue I had with this place is the plethora of red meat and no poultry in sight. I had told several different meat bearers that I wanted poultry or pork but yet all that kept arriving to our table was red meat. And even when I saw the little wings on their meat serving rods they would skip our table and jump to all the other tables instead of ours. I finally got so upset that I went up to the manager and complained. Only then did we have all sorts of variety of poultry and pork come our way in waves. I understand that it is very busy but they need to have a better way to serve the tables and keep the patrons happy. All in all I ended up leaving stuffed because I kept taking so much poultry because I then felt bad that I complained and they sent every single waiter in the place to our table to appease us. I thank the management team for doing their best to make our visit a pleasant one.

It was our very first time eating at a Brazilian steakhouse. We arrived around 6:45pm on Wednesday night. I ordered tap water for the family, but they gave us a spring bottle water and charged $9. It made no sense because they had a man serving water for free. It would've been nice if the waitress warned us about that. We did say it was our first time. Other than that the meat service was great! My favorite meat selection were Beef Tenderloin Steak, steak sirloin, and BBQ spare ribs. The warm cinnamon pineapple was delicious. The salad/entree bar wasn't bad. You get salads, rice, pasta, and American foods like chicken nuggets and french fries. It's $38.75 per person. Then you add drinks, tax, and gratuity. You can spend about $50 per person. Do not eat a lot at the salad/entree bar. Try the meats! They offer sausages, pork, beef, chicken, and steak."

George I believe was the one who served us and he went above and beyond to cater our needs. He even went out of his way just to get us lamb even though it wasn't rotating at that moment. All in all I loved the place and will definitely be going back again!

We were a large group approximately 40-50 people. This is a large rodizio place. It is the typical size of an all you can eat buffet. It is nicely decorated and it was a comfortable temperature- important to me because I hate a freezing cold restaurant. They have a large selection of food to eat from their salad bar and hot food trays. Included in the drinks you can have is soda. Strike one in my book- you can't include coffee or tea?! I'm not saying a cappuccino or Earl Grey or something like that. I mean a lipton tea bag or plain sanka coffee is not too much to ask. Strike two was that I had to wait approximately 57 minutes before I finally saw someone with meat come around. Now I know we were a large group so they were letting us settle in but some of us only came to eat the meat- not to fill up on the salad bar. A real pro rodizio eater knows- forgo the sides and load up on the meat! Now note I said I saw someone come around with the meat he skipped me because I did not have a plate. (I had no idea about this plate thing when they had mini plates on the table.  That should have been clear especially with as many times as I asked about the meat!) So I had to wait for him to make his rounds and then I was able to sample what was left of his selection. The meat comes out very slow at this place. There does not seem to be a rhythm or method to it. Just someone will pop up every now and again. There was a lot of lag time waiting for the meats to come around. (I was sitting on an end so I was easily accessible to the guachos (meat servers) to get to) Food: The guachos come around with Bacon wrapped chicken, bacon wrapped filet mignon, bbq ribs, spare ribs, buffalo chicken, bbq chicken, prime rib, roast beef, lemon crusted pork  loin, cinnamon dusted pineapple and kebab meat. There is also the option to try duck, quail and lamb but they don't really advertise this. I had to ask for this twice. Salad bar: olives, bean salad, pickles, pepers/gherkins, beet salad, spicy mango (mango chow) , corn, cucumber salad, chickpeas, artichokes, Caesar salad, jello, fruit salad, chips, salsa, shredded meat, imitation crab meat, roasted potatoes, pasta salads, other green salads, spicy chicken, chicken nuggets, onion rings, platanos, french fries, cauliflower, broccoli, creamed spinach, mashed potatoes, gravy, chicken marsala, tilapia oreganto, shrimp bobo, shaghetti bolognese, mac and cheese, yellow rice, and black beans with bacon.  Overall Experience: I think perhaps my experience was lackluster because the main waiter for our party seemed a bit overwhelmed. He had a helper at first (Emely) but then she disappeared and it was just him. I really wished that I could say I liked this place especially in light of its price point. You get a lot for the price plus dessert. However, this experience has sullied it for me. Perhaps I will give them another try, but for right now, I'd rather go to a place that doesn't have me begging for what I paid for."

I used to come a lot, probably 10 or more years ago but for whatever reason I haven't been back until recently. It's a Brazilian style restaurant and if you have never been to one, and you love meat, then you are missing out. They have Valet Parking which is convenient and its free as well. Pull up and you get a ticket and no worries there. You walk thru two sets of doors and the hostess is right there. We were seated right away, and its a very large restaurant.So there is a decent salad bar and small hot food buffet, mostly sides. But you didn't come here for that. Do yourself a favor and don't load up on the buffet stuff. The salad bar is good and the sides are rice, pasta, beans, soup and a few more. Once your grab the sides you wait for the meat. There's a card now on the table for each person and depending if you want more or not you have it turned to a certain side. The meat is bought out on skewers and every minute or so something new is out. There was skirt steak, lamb, bacon wrapped filet, more steak, chicken, and more meat that I don't remember. If you have room there's a dessert cart rolling around with red velvet cake, cheese cake and a few more. It was pricier than I remember but that was a long time ago and I thought this place has gotten better so well worth it. I will be back soon."

Once we arrive we already know the drill to get the plates stacked and get back to the table to murder the meats to come out.

I used to enjoy this place.My last two birthday celebration dinners have been here. My brother enjoyed it so much he had his birthday here. I called this location as I have done in the past to make a reservation for a table. I confirmed  my reservation for 14 people. I confirmed with the hostess if the policy was the same which I was told in years past and this year that in order for you party to be seated you would need 50 percent of your guest to be present. Proceed to the night of October 6th 2018. I arrived to the restaurant 10 minutes prior to my scheduled reservation with 2 of my guest. I greeted the hostess and explained that I was the here early and that U was waiting for some more guest to arrive. Currently there are 3 of us waiting on the 4 more so that we would be seated. Within 5 mins 2 more people showed up and then 3 minutes after that 2 more people showed up and roughly after  2 mins after that 1 more guest showed up. So now the total of guest are 8. I reapproach the hostess and explain that I have 8 guest here ready to be seated so that we can startvto situate out selfs. The host then flat out said that you would need to have 80 percent of your guest to be seated. To my suprise I explained to her that When I made my reservation they told me that ai would need 50 peecent of my guest to ve seated. She then called a manager who was unwilling to seat us with 8 of the 14 people of my party.As I am going back and forth with this manager in regards to being seated 2 more of my guest walk in bring my total of guest to 10. And you guessed it even with 10 guest they still would not seat us. Now we are queued waiting damn near all the way in the bathroom. A truly embaraasing moment. I ask to speak with the owner and then the manager proceeds to call hom over. As I am going back and forth with the owner of the establishment 2 more of guest arrive and you guessed it they still did not want to seat me. After a couple more minutes the manager reluctantly sat us. The manager did not even have the respect to look me in thr eyes as he was talking to me. I will never patton this establishment again. Our waitress was non attentive and we found ourselves dying of thirst. The picana is the best meat there but ai am pretty sure I can get that some where else at the same level if not better.I hate to use the race card but I feel as if the manager tried to profile me at this location. We spent over 700 dollars that night. Really loved this place in the past but now I dont see my self ever going there again

Explains drinks and desert is not included. Also they will take your drink. I ordered the Rainhas signature pineapple caipirinha. Signature caipirinha has mixture of vodka, pineapple, pineapple juice and lime on ice.We then headed to the buffet and helped ourselves with some salad, fruit, sushi, soup, beef stew, fish, mix vegetable.After finishing our appetisers. Ramos and his staff comes with continues meat until you are full and fill your card to red.Service was great, dishes were replaced and water was refilled. A lady will push deserts around and if you have appetite, she will take your order. I had tres leche, which was delicious; not too sweet.Before we leave, 2 dancers started dancing around the restaurant. If you didn't make reservation, expect 1/2 to 1 hour wait.This restaurant is very well run.Excellent!!"

I haven't been here in about two or three years. The first time I came here the servers were constantly bringing out different cuts of meats but this time around it was pretty sad. They brought out two different sausages, bacon wrapped chicken, roast beef, top sirloin, and pineapple. Where were the other cuts of meats?!?!?! The servers were very friendly but I came here to gorge myself in MEATS. I was not full and ended up eating pasta from the salad bar. After tip and tax, I think each one of us paid like $50/person. This place is not like what it was and I won't be coming back here again."

Unfortunately, when we went it was around the holidays and the meat came over rather slowly (there were 5-10min pauses that I had no meat on my plate) and I became full. I enjoyed their pineapple, corn and picanha dishes. You have to pay extra for dessert :(Price: about $40 a person. The norm for Brazilian AYCE BBQ.Service: Service was good. Our waitress came up to check on us frequently. The slow part were the meats :(Parking & Finding the Place: They have valet parking.Additional Thoughts/Tips: Maybe i'll pick a slower period to come as there are less tables for the meats to visit"

Never going back. Place was recommended as was told it's great. Decided to check it out. Had a horrible experience in 2017. Decided to give it another try. Not surprising- had another bad experience. First of all- they accuse u of sharing food. Maybe some customers do that. But do not go around accusing ppl just because that's what u want to do. Secondaly, they charge for everyone on the table. Even if it's a 3 month old baby- like seriously!!! Because the baby ate the food , inhaled the air or occupied space -1 seat-  in ur massive area??Food maybe great. But customer service is horrible. Takes away from ur appetite.2 tries is more than enough. Left the place with a bad taste in my mouth. Adios peeps. Never again."

This place is located in Queens, right near LaGuardia airport. On a Thursday night, we were able to get seated pretty quickly and head over to the side bar, which had plenty of great options and it was pretty well maintained. The sides were not bad and then came the severs with the meats...fantastic. Everything served was absolutely delicious and what I liked most about this place was the juicy smoked pineapple that was the perfect flavor to complement the meat. My server made me a cocktail that was so awesome that I was convinced that I was bi....lingual. I cant pronounce the cocktail with Spanish ingredients right now but at the time, I thought I was fluent lol, so that alone was an experience I equally enjoyed and bonus to the food. I also really enjoyed the price. For the quality, I thought it was a pretty decent price point and I certainly didn't leave disappointed."

We selected this  restaurant only because it could accommodate a large  group .Problem : service was bad they didn't come around with as much of a selection or water for our group  .When  I asked for our cake they placed it on a dirty table no clean plate or utensils and walked away .When our waiter came  back to our area, he argued with me making  excuses as to why he  didn't clean the table off . We then asked to speak to a manager  a female came out to our table had a nasty attitude , didn't not seem apologetic or as if she wanted to resolve any issues  she quickly said with an attitude that she doesn't want to many people speaking to her ( I immediately shut down cause I know myself ) and her attitude was to much my husband tried to explain what happened ,she told my husband she would have to roll back the cameras to see what actually happened ,But her workers did nothing wrong .  What's crazy is that a few days later ,I kid u not someone called from the restaurant saying that they were sorry for the managers behavior and that they normally treat African Americans as such cause they feel that  we won't  tip , what's a tip when your spending $1000 at an establishment .

She was pleasant but at one point we friend to order a specific drink and she said they didn't have it but then we saw other people with it so maybe we were describing it properly. They food was delicious and cooked properly. Honestly I've been to quite a few Brazilian steakhouses around the country and this was the least impressive but it was good. I have no real complaints and you get free valet parking which is nice. I'd go again!"

As for the food, as a whole it had its ups and downs, but experience wise this was a FANTASTIC choice for a big group gathering.Let's start from the beginning -- the arrival. The restaurant offers valet parking, but if you're not a fan of valet parking like me, then there's plenty of street parking nearby, including right in front of the restaurant. The restaurant had a very elegant feel to it and, to sum it up best, looked very classy. Although the decor was nice and modern, there was NO dress code at all so there was an assortment of people dressing to impress to people who were very casual .... and I MEAN very casual with baseball caps, running sneakers, t-shirts, etc. The bar was located right after the entrance and there were a few TVs for those who wanted to just relax there. The restaurant had a very open feel to it and you really could see the entire dining area throughout wherever you stood or sat, including the bar.After arrival, our party was seated promptly and, since we were starving, we got straight down to business! We were asked for our drink orders, then proceeded straight to the salad bar and hot buffet. The salad bar and hot buffet weren't huge, but there was plenty enough there to wet our appetites. Pastas, rice, oxtail, various cold pastas, salads and cut up fruits were just a sample of what they had to offer. A word of advice --- If you paid $35.95 for access to the full rotation of meats, DON'T GET FILLED UP ON THE SALAD BAR OR HOT BUFFET! It's quite tempting to load up a plate of goodness from there, but the meats begin arriving fast and furiously after you sit as it did for us so hold on tight and be patient. So many different waiters with variations of meats began approaching our table so quickly that our heads were spinning - Sauages, pork, different cuts of steak, prime rib, spare ribs, lechon (roast pig) - you name it they had it! They even had grilled pineapple slices going around! Despite the decent variety (as there should be), the meats were ok. 60% of the meats were unfortunately cooked too well and dried out, while some were a bit too much on the raw side. Even though we were disappointed in some of the meats, there were still 2 verrrrry bright spots in the spare ribs and lechon. The spare ribs were literally fall off the bone! Moist, juicy and super duper tender. The lechon was cooked perfectly -- moist meat and extra crispy skin -- just the way we love our roast pig.If you manage to stay awake after the gastronomic test you just had and have some room for dessert, the restaurant offers it for extra charge. Once in awhile, someone will roll a wagon of cakes around ranging from red velvet, tiramisu, tres leches, chocolate and try to tempt you to fit a slice into your quickly expanding tire of a belly. In closing, as for the capacity of the restaurant, we were seated at around 7pm and the restaurant was only about half full, however when 8pm rolled around the place was full to the brim so reservations seem like the best way to go. Birthday parties were rampant throughout and huge parties of 15+ were scattered all over the restaurant. Our experience here was very good and the service was truly excellent, but the meats have some room for improvement and correction, which can be done. With that said, for $35.99/person it's so hard to beat this Churrascaria deal and worth at least 1 go around!"

Arrived for a business dinner. The meat they served was delicious. Everything they gave us was really good although it felt like force feeding. However the food under the chafing dishes left something to be desired. I stuck with the Cesar salad and stayed away from the other options. All in all a fun place to eat but a far cry from fine dining.

The staff is all very hard working making sure the food is fresh, the water cups are full and you are always satisfied.  Of note is one gentleman, Johnny - see the photo attached.  He truly works hard, loves what he does and makes the experience even better than the 5 star rating.  I will definitely be back.  Thanks Johnny!!"

Nothing special about this place. Texas de Brazil has better cuts of meats. Service here was also slow. We paid $32 for a pitcher of sangria that was filled to the top with ice, and it took 10 mins. to arrive. No one checked on our table. No one cleared our plates. Bo one refilled our water. If we didn't flag someone down, I think we may have had to cook the food ourselves."

You get what you pay for.I wanted to try this place out because it was near where my friend lived and was cheaper than the Brazilian places in the city... Well, there is a reason: way less meat. There was like 6 different types of meat. 2-3 were very similar. I saw a waiter with ribs but when I asked about it, was told its an hour wait for more. I spent more time waiting for another waiter to come than eating. This doesn't happen at fogo de chao or churrascaria."

My favorite items of their menu were the barbq ribs and grilled pine apple! The meat was so tender it came right off the bone. The pineapple was perfectly picked and grilled to perfection topped with a sprinkle of cinnamon. The L.I.Ts are nice and strong so ask for one of those! For dessert, ask for the flan. Unlike what I'm use to, the flan is sweet and light. Enjoy :)"

The ambiance here is always amazing and the service is out of this world. Karla was our waitress and she always made sure we were tended to. One of the servers Johnny (hope I spelled that right lol!) was always serving us with a smile and giggles. He told us the best meats and what to savor.

Try getting a table in the main dinner my area by the salad bar much more lively.   Had a very good time more Spanish style then Brazilian Yes !

Had to flag a waiter/waitress every time I need anything. No attention to the customer (this is a Rodizio Steakhouse). Topping it off they would not accept any credit card without a chip.

We were seated right away. They have a buffet of assorted foods. We really enjoyed the salad bar but the rice and beans were very well seasoned. SO MUCH MEAT comes around. They definitely enjoy getting their customers very full. Johnny took very good care of us. He made sure we tried every type of meat they offer including their new item the garlic chicken. The garlic chicken was definitely my favorite! The have a cart of desserts that they wheel around to everyone and we had the the cheesecake. Everything was so good and the service was great which is definitely hard to come by! We will be coming back and we hope to see Johnny again!

It used to be so much better. Food was not up to stardard.   Was a bit disappointed on the buffet selections. They don't have oxtail!   We do not  want fries and chicken fingers.  The buffet was a bit mediocre. The bbq meat were not flavorful either. Everything started tasting the same. Their selection of steak were limited as we only see the same meat coming out. For the  price we want flavorful tasty quality food. We didn't get that.  We needed to dip on sauces to get the flavor. Service?  Eh. Not much. We very much took care of  ourselves. We do not plan to go back.  Its overrated. For that money I can eat better food.

I've always enjoyed the food. The meats are well seasoned and made just right! Service is great. Johnny (one of the servers) is very friendly and he'll make sure you'll enjoy your meal.

It was good, I had a few in my days and it perfecto for them having the muddled pineapple and lime. Caipirinha is a Brazilian rum. The food was delicious, from the steak, roast beef, pork with the melted mozzarella cheese, cooked to steak perfection in terms of being juicy and savory. We had a waiter was good, gave us a lot of meat to taste and try, however, he became a bit overwhelming due to his eagerness to make us meat even when we turned  the place card to say we want no more meat, he continued to come. It was like do you not see the card. Had to politely tell him we were full. Thats not to say we didn't like the attention, there needs to be a balance especially in a resturant setup like that. Giving me more doesn't increase the tip I am going to give you.  Needless to say, it's a family oriented resturant.  The kids will enjoy. It's big enough to host large parties. There's valet parking which is a plus in busy and congested Northern Blvd."

Boy oh boy was I unprepared for what the night held for me and our dinner party. The decor is very nice. It was love at first sight when my eyes saw the waterfall wall........oh my goodness I absolutely love to be around water although I don't know how to swim lol....it soothes my soul. We had a party of 28 people for our friend's surprise birthday dinner party. We had to wait in the front of the restaurant before we were seated because some of us were there early. I explained to the greeter why we needed to be seated before the guest of honor arrived and within twenty minutes we were seated when at least half of the guests had arrived which was definitely cool. When the birthday girl arrived, it was time for us to get our eat on. Now I still didn't understand the dynamics of the restaurant. The salad bar is AWESOME! There were different meats, entrees and sides surrounding the salad bar. I'm thinking to myself after loading my plate, that the meat selection wasn't all that. Oh how I was proved wrong within minutes after I started eating my food. A wonderful gentleman comes to my table with piping hot steak fresh off the grill on skewers, ready to give us sliced meat right at the table. Oh my goodness the amount of meat that was brought to the table made me feel like what did I do to be able to partake in this wonderful experience. Filet mignon wrapped with bacon, boneless chicken wrapped with bacon, sausages, fresh sweet corn, chicken wings, all kinds of beef fresh off the grill........AWESOME! All of the meat served was absolutely seasoned and cooked to perfection. When they brought grilled pineapple sprinkled with cinnamon to the table, we all fell in love all over again with Rainhas. All of the servers were awesome and very attentive to our needs. I will definitely be back soon."

And when I asked the manager that day he said and I kid you not ""awesome sauce"" like did he understand what I was trying to tell him about refilling it since my girlfriend is a vegan, not the kind of response I was waiting. At least take ownership of a mistake that's why you are a ""manager"" I personally asked for Roberto when I made my reservations they told me he no longer works there, thank god George was there again to help me out. The meat was 10/10, like always Johnny is the best and always listens to us, that keen attention in how we want our meat is legit because not all servers are like that. Thank you for the wonderful food, ask for the pineapple I recommend it, but please have someone out there who knows how to speak to your customers in a professional matter."

The sides were so good. The only complaints about the place was it was cold for some reason & also did not like how dessert was not included in the buffet. However, the food was plentiful and very satisfying. The waitress Yennifer was nice & the bathroom downstairs was clean. I appreciate a restaurant with clean bathrooms. I would recommend for people for special occasions not everyday dining. It is quite pricey but worth it for a special night out! I enjoyed my experience at Rainhas!"

Tenderloin, skirt steak, pork bbq ribs, chicken, etc all amazing! The gentlemen offering us the meat were very kind with a good sense of humor making our experience even better.

My party of 5 arrived for a bachelor party dinner. We were promptly seated (the only reason they got a star) but the meat runners seemed to have an aversion to our section (our cards were all flipped to green btw). After an initial selection of burnt sausage and bacon wrapped chicken jerky, we noticed 3 different types of meats going right past us to the other 2 sections of the restaurant (we were seated right by the meat prep station) while our plates remained empty. They essentially fill you up with cheap selections then run out the 2 hour time limit. Worth it? No."

Once more you guys went above and beyond to treat my Annual Office Dinner like if it was your own. This is the second year we have it at Rainhas and I have to say it didn't disappoint.I want to point out 3 of your employees, Ms. Celeste she went beyond her duties to make sure EVERYONE was taken care of, Mr. Jonathan never stopped, he went from cleaning the tables all the way to help me discard of a box, he went all over and always willing to assist and the girl that was doing the desserts almost to the end of the night (her name escapes my mind, I apologize) She was so so accommodating. I will not leave out all the (rodizios) men they were funny and helpful. I don't have a single complaint from your place and have to point out that it was even more busy than last year around the same time and yet you guys met each and every need of my party, I thank you for that!Again, Thank you for an exceptional night! you guys ROCK!

Servers - excellent Food- excellent Salad bar- excellentDecor-excellent Ambiance- excellent These servers and workers need to be getting paid top dollar. We love you Johnny the meat server.

Food wise i would give it 3 stars due to the smaller than normal variety of their salad bar (incomparison to other brazilian steakhouses) and some of the food was pretty salty although again, most places like this oversalt their meats. Loveddd the corn but i would scrape off a ton of salt. My family members loved the cinnamon glazed pineapple and the chicken hearts i believe? Brisket and wings were nothing special but the ribs, top sirloin, spicy sausage and steak/chicken wrapped in bacon were delicious. Did not really like their cheesy bread it tasted like straight up cheese to me i've had much better. Celebrated my birthday here so i got a slice of tiramisu with a sparkler which was super cute :)Bumped up the star rating for Johnny he was an amazing server! If we asked or mentioned something (or if we even overheard us) we wanted more of he made it a point to come back to our table of 13. Appreciated that for sure!"

The taste was rancid. The meat was chewy. The buffet is very basic. Desserts are extra (unless you wanna stuff your face with jello). Soda drinks are NOT included. 174 USD plus gratuity for 3 persons and no dessert. For this amount of money you can eat in the best Churrascaria in Manhattan. Their best item was probably the grilled pineapple. This place is horrendous. I feel so angry to have wasted my money on this. Learn from other people's mistakes. Don't go there.

The meat is fairly juicy but would be better if it is was a bit more tender. The pork ribs is the most tender and tastes really good- would highly recommend!

They have a large variety of cuts and can request to have your meats at whatever temperature you desire. They also have a nice selection of sides at the buffet which are very different than other Churrascarias (ig. they have seafood sides and other types of meats). The drinks are also delicious. Must try the pineapple, one of their signatures :)"

Salad bar and hot buffet is horrible! Meats has no flavor at all and service is ridiculous.They must change the name because this is longer to be a Brazilian Churrascaria."

We tried this place because we love Churrascaria and it's a little less expensive than the places in the city. We went on a week night, which I understand isn't always the best time to experience a new place, but we walked out just feeling sad and disappointed. The salad bar is BASIC. Sad mostly empty bowls of wilted salad toppings. No plantains or any of the other accompaniments you expect. They had some other main dishes (chicken Marsala, spaghetti bolognese) that honestly looked inedible and untouched. The worst part was that there was NO CHEESE BREAD. I found out at the end of the meal that you could request it, but it would take 10 minutes or so. As far as the meats go, the quality was fine but the selection was disappointing, and the rotation was sparse. Also everything was clearly seasoned with A1 steak sauce which is fine on steak, but really bizarre on pork loin...To put it simply, there's nothing worth returning for."

I was thinking of becoming a regular here with my husband and kids, I didn't feel the same energy with the staff unless he is around. The food was great, I love coming here since it's a super close to me, my husband likes to come here because all he talks about with Roberto are the sports you know guy things so I can't come here anymore.

The 2 steak meats were overdone (although ""medium""), tough and lacked flavor. The only 2 meat dishes that I liked were the bacon wrapped meat (filet mignon I believe) and the cheese covered pork but here the topping on top added the needed flavor to the meat. The buffet was also not impressive.Service - our waitress was attentive and nice. My biggest annoyance was that the restaurant stopped coming around with steaks/meat over 45 min before closing. In my mind, that was much too early especially when there were plenty of tables still occupied."

The mango sorbet was very delicious as everything else. We didn't bring a birthday cake,not knowing that they offered the singing at the table. They sang Happy Birthday in tune and made my father in law feel very special. It was my first time coming here rather than my fiancée's and his family.

Unfortunately this will be the last time I ever come to this place again. I was with a group of three. They sat us in a closet! It was so small and cramped. I was seated right next to a table with small noisy children. They were running around the tables and yelling. The parent would just sit there and then have sudden outburst of yelling and hitting. The meat that normally comes to all the tables did not come to us because as I repeat we WERE IN A CLOSET! Being put in a box felt as if I was being punished for coming to this place. I understand if space was limited or if they were only taking big parties but they weren't. I saw tables of two, three and four sitting in the main area. This was suppose to be a wonderful mother's day dinner but instead it was a horrible one."

( i guess i was hungry) all the food was hot (sometimes buffet style might get a little cold) lol overall i had a great experience. The meat selection was awesome!!.. ribs, steak, chicken, beef, you name it my fav was the pork loin with lemon pepper covered in mozzarella it was  so delicious!!

But 5 stars for service and the amazing pineapples. Not sure if it was because it was a Sunday but they didn't have that many options and the guys weren't going around as much.

The quality of the meat is subpar. The picture below is the bacon wrapped ""fillet"" but it's more like bacon wrapped fat and gristle. Each piece of meat I cut into was extremely tough. The only flavor of the meat came from the chimichurri sauce, which was delicious. Labeling the items at the salad bar is crucial because nobody knows what is what up there. The restaurant really wasn't that busy but yet it took at least 4 times to ask for a Coke. I'm leaving a buffet hungry. I wouldn't return to this place unless the quality of the meat goes up."

However our waiter was a bit inattentive. He seemed to always be in a rush. And maybe he was after all it was Saturday night. I don't blame him. I blame the establishment. They should consider hiring more waiters for the weekend service. For the amount of money they are changing for plate they should provide more attentive service. Also my husband was sitting next to the wall water feature  and he kept getting wet. They should consider moving the tables away from it.

But if you were looking for a longer review i can go into detail. Ironic enough, the best thing about this place is the pineapple that is served table side. It is cooked with a sort of cinnamon coating and just gushes with flavor in your mouth. All of the meat(s) are cooked to perfection and seasoned perfectly, and the service is very quick. Also, the sides, which weren't very necessary due to the quality of meat, were very well seasoned, cooked, and prepared. If i could give this place 6 stars out of 5 i would. Hands down."

To top it off an hour into dinner (perfect for digestion) there was a performance with a Brazilian samba dance."

It's a beautiful establishment   with exotic decor and a fantastic waterfall glass wall. The noise level is respectfully low with a highly attentive staff.The menu price is a little extravagant. We had an early service for dinner. The salad bar was not very impressive. I wasn't a fan of the dried up Mac and Cheese and dried up tilapia. The salad and side dishes were basic and simple. Jello was the highlight. However, who goes there for salad, right? The long awaited came out quickly and often: lamb, sirloin, brisket, pork belly, the works. Shish kabobs did not disappoint. All meats came out in  large portion. They gave you a card: green for Yes and orange for no.I have no complaints for meats. It was done in a  phenomenal fashion. Ribs were good. Beef ribs were amazing. You cannot leave this establishment without trying the grilled pineapples. They are out of this world and they melt in your mouth.The one warning that I have is that they get you on drinks. They didn't tell me that drinks were not refillable. $2.50 a piece. Alcoholic drinks were priced obviously the high end: $13 each. If you want dessert, it's $8.95 which did not bother me because I was too full anyway."

The staff is super attentive and it's pretty easy to get a table at 6pm for two on a Saturday. The FREE valet parking is definitely a plus since the parking in Corona isn't always great. The wait staff comes around constantly to refill your drinks, bring by meat, or clear your buffet plate so you can go get another round. The food at the buffet is delicious as well. And they make awesome cocktails. Between the amazing price (35 per person), the awesome selection of food, the great wait staff and the drinks, you really cannot go wrong."

The service and environment is great, but for the price and food choice are terrible 1. The light of half of the restaurant is off. It looks very empty.2. The buffet bar section is really low quality. Three different types of salad and some picked vegetables. There are also some different kinds of rice....3. There are totally around six kind of meat rotation. No Lamb from Monday to Thursday. After talking with the waitress, she told us there are much more meat choices from Friday to Sunday.The price is always the same. I don't understand why they offer different menu without mentioning on website."

Two years later and Johnny was serving us again and remembered us! He's always so friendly and keeps up with us and whatever we want to come around to the table he makes sure to bring to us. He makes the experience there overall amazing!! Definitely fulfills the needs of his customers and pays close attention to them.

Because then all the employees are running around with skewers of the different kinds of meat. The first time I went, the meat was just coming and going, I could wait a few minutes for the ones I wanted.The second time I went, the restaurant was filled about half way, so there would just be one or two guys bringing out skewers. This service was much slower and I didn't enjoy the experience then.The dessert prices are jacked up like crazy, but they taste good. Whether or not you want to drop $9 for that, it's up to you.The pineapple is the best thing here."

From the meat to the sides I loved every bit of it. I recommend the shrimp, Mac and cheese, mashed potatoes, and broccoli. The meats were really out of this world I loved th steak and ribs. I usually don't like sausage but the salchichas were amazing. If you get the chance to eat here you won't regret it!"

It's well worth the price. The buffet is huge and extremely tasty. But don't get full off of that because the meat is none stop. They come around with over 30 different types of meats and the pineapple was Delicius. They didn't rush you out like most places which was good and they have valet parking. The best part other then the food and attentive service was the special drinks. It's a must that you get one. I can still taste it. We will be back for more very soon!

I literally ate my body weight in assorted meats and that's never a bad thing.The atmosphere has a relaxed elegance that anyone from the young to the elderly can enjoy. The staff was very friendly and made sure our plates were never empty and our stomachs full. The wine was also very good ( recommend the Malbec) My only issue was the buffet station. To me it was sort of lacking and I don't think they came out to replace any of the food the whole time I was there. Granted it was a Monday night and pouring raining so not many customers so they get a pass cause everything else was so great. I definitely recommend this place to anyone celebrating a birthday or just wants a nice evening out with an all you can eat experience. Tip - make sure you bring your fat pants and enjoy!

Beautiful. Price wasn't terrible considering it's all you can eat. The meat didn't come around quick enough for me, the food wasn't the tastiest, and the variety at the hot buffet section wasn't the greatest. I have had better. I liked the concept of the restaurant. Not mad I went but probably will not be back"

There was a great selection of meats served at the table. Also a decent selection at the buffet. My only complaint is that they did not give additional silverware as we were transitioning plates. And I know they make money off of drinks, but $5 for a tea with no honey available seems a bit much. But I would definitely revisit. It also had a nice atmosphere with music and the waterfall wall"

However, it isn't my first time trying Brazilian food. Having tried Brazilian cuisine in Las Vegas, I decided to remind myself what it tasted like. I made reservations over the phone two days ahead of arrival. They called me a day before arrival and confirmed. We were seated promptly upon arrival. I forgot to mention, there is valet parking available in their parking lot. You have a choice of getting the meat with the buffet which costs about $35pp, and without the meat which is their general buffet which is around $22pp. I got the buffet because my friends got the meat buffet. What I mean by the meat buffet is that waiters come around with a rack of meat (lamb, ribeye, pineapple, more steak, chicken, beef..and so forth) and you can decide whether or not you want the meat. I was satisfied because I went for rounds of Cesar salad! I know, I came here for salad. But it was great. But not only that, there was oxtail and it was soft and meat fell right off with a bite, beef stew, cold sides, sushi (wouldn't suggest it), soups, typical fried foods, etc.Overall, service was good. Had to get a cake for the birthday boy, but there are no complimentary ones! Large restaurant and wasn't even packed on a Friday night."

And the food was great. Buffet includes chicken marsala, shrimp, soups, and salads. The kale salad was my favorite. Endless supply of meats. Sirloin, tenderloin, and the filet wrapped in bacon.

They charged gratuity for 8 or more people even though baby didn't get any service. Then tried to upcharge all 7 for rodizio, even though only 4 had it. Waiters never even asked initially how many people were doing rodizio.. stating that waiters saw people sharing meat. We didn't. The waiter accidentally put that in one of the plates and it was removed. Also charged for a drink we didn't have. Took supervisor and manager to fix the bill, including mention of better business bureau."

Just like Texas de Brazil but 10000000x better. Meat selections from steak duck lamb chicken bacon. There's a pineapple dessert and it's the best pineapple I've ever had. Food is juicy and never dry.

The first time we came here we didn't let anyone know our intentions to get a feel for this place. We were really impressed with the service, the cleanliness of the place and the simple yet classy décor. We just had our engagement party last week and I must say that Rainhas Churrascaria still did not disappoint. I had had a few email conversations with the sales manager Karina regarding our event.  She was always very responsive, answered all of my questions and always encouraged me to contact her for any questions or issues. The day before the event we made arrangements to decorate the Rio Room (Private Room).  On the day of the event...the staff was extremely accommodating and very hospitable. They were very professional and worked with us every step of the way. I couldn't have asked for a better staff to work with in making the event a success. The staff was organized, the food was hot and on time, ready to be served to the guests. All the guests really enjoyed the food,( which is one of the reasons why we chose the place.) Finding a reasonably priced location for an event can be hard. Rainhas made our choice easy. I was truly impressed by the service, and the hospitality of the staff and the Team that worked there. The service was amazing...and they catered to every need we had...including setting up another table for our guests on short notice (we already had 102 guests).  This is a great place to host an event....for a lot of people. They even have Valet Parking."

Make sure you get it! Now on to the meats....they have so many different cuts of beef, pork & chicken. I absolutely loved the beef wrapped in bacon. All the meat was juicy and delicious. I love their buffet too. The last place I went to only had cold limited selections. Rainhas had a delicious hot food buffet (mashed potatoes, roasted cauliflower, broccoli, Mac & Cheese, Rice & beans...) and salad bar for the best of both worlds. Definitely worth the money and I would come back in a heartbeat."

Nothing is specified as what qualifies as ""meat"", and ""non-meat"". One of the food servers come to our table, asking us if we wanted corn. One of our ""non-meat"" people accept the corn,  logically thinking that corn didn't count as meat. Turns out however, that that wasn't the case, and as a result we were forced to pay an extra $10 because apparently corn counts as meat and no one was told. Not only that, but it costs an extra $1.50 per person in order for them to cut a cake for us?! But wait, it gets worse from there. Of course, a buffet is expected to be all-inclusive, but dessert costs extra?! A cut of cake costed an outrageous $8.95. Despite these inappropriate actions, a ""gratuity"" is mandated at a large 18-20%, considering the extraordinary prices. Absolutely terrible."

The ambience of this restaurant is pretty fancy but they don't enforce any dress code. As with most churrascaria, there is a sort of salad buffet but this one also offers hot items such as chicken fingers, onion rings, and French fries (kid-friendly food). They also had roasted chicken and various sides such as rice, steamed veggies and mashed potatoes. In my opinion, most of the sides were pretty bland and lacking in a lot of flavor. But then again, you don't go to Brazilian buffets for the sides! Let's get too the good stuff- the endless meats. There are various servers walking around with char-grilled meats on large skewers. With your place card turned up, they will all come to you and offer you the cut/type of meat they are serving. The meat itself is cooked very well- flavorful with different temps offered. They also have a grilled corn which is absolutely amazing. A lot of people talk about the pineapple which was pleasant but probably not amazing. Servers here are extremely attentive and friendly. If you want a specific item, just ask and they will bring it to you. Definitely A+ service. I also have to emphasize the ambience of this place. There are large windows with water flowing down, reminiscent of waterfalls which goes great with the restaurant name ""rainhaus"". Already planning my next trip back!"

The hostess said yes no problem.  When we arrived we told them we had 13 people.  We figured not a biggie if we added an extra chair.  Can you believe they put us on a table for a party of 10????  Then they tried to tell us we made the reservation only for 10. So they had to look at the paper and yes it was changed to 12 people. We told the manager that i had called early that morning and they told us it was okay. They said give them 10mins and they'll move us.  Are you kidding?  We kept checking and they said soon. soon... We were so effin squished. My husband - THE BIRTHDAY BOY didn't even sit inside the table.  He had to hold his plate to eat.  NEVER again will we go to Rainhas.  Apologies don't make things better! Bad management gives bad service!

They've got everything you crave that's korean: ooey gooey ddukbogi rice cakes, crispy crunchy sweet chicken wings, and heart warming tofu soups and fried rice/noodles. Our soy chicken wings were marvelously crispy without being greasy; they thoughtfully packed it so air could escape from the container without making the chicken soggy en route to your home. i also ordered a beef seafood soup, and it tasted exactly like the tofu soup i love and remember eating growing up; i had not been able to find a place that had that depth of flavor, but i am so thankful i can now purchase this just a few blocks from where i live. they also filled our order to the brim with banchan/appetizer/pickled side dishes and miso soup. Was not expecting to receive this much, but it really rounded out our meal. the kimbaps are great and affordable options to snack on or have a quick lunch as well. we got the shrimp tempura and the bulgogi bc i have no self control. i will thank myself later as i munch on them the rest of the week :)In our 100% accurate order, we even received a chocopie and seaweed with the sweetest handwritten thank you note. It was also prepared quite quickly (within 15 minutes!). When picking up your own food, head around to the side (there will be signs directing you where to go and what doorbell to ring). Right now they're only taking online orders through third party sites (Seamless, Yelp etc), so you can't call in orders from your personal phone. I sincerely, genuinely hope this place makes it through these terrible times and becomes a thriving staple of LIC. I literally just put away the leftovers from this wonderful meal and had to write this review.tl;drYou will not regret supporting this delicious kitchen; I can't wait to keep coming back again and again."

Lim's appears to have a fairly robust menu with many Korean staples that I look forward to trying. On my first order today, I tried the fried chicken sandwich and tuna kimbap. Both were great! Each item was $8, an awesome value for the quality. The sandwich in particular was great and something I'd definitely order again. Delivery was very quick too with the food still warm.Only downside was I didnt actually order tuna kimbap, but instead bulgogi kimbap. Not going to deduct a star as I'm sure it was an honest mistake and it was still good, but hopefully they get the order right next time."

This location used to be Crescent Grill. We actually really wanted to try it but it closed down before we got a chance.

The food smelled soo good as soon as we opened the bag. Only thing to note is we wish the dumplings came with a dipping sauce. Overall, everything was delicious! When we feel it's safe to go out to eat again, we would definitely go to Lim's. If not, then we would do take out again. They included a little thank you note with a Choco Pie to stay safe.

The spicy pork kimbab was really good and I strongly recommend it. About the fried chicken, I enjoyed the scale of each piece. However, I wish there was more soy garlic sauce on the chicken and the sauce had a stronger flavor profile.

I'm usually wary of ordering Korean food outside of Flushing, Bayside, Fort Lee, Palisades Park, and KTown in Manhattan -- but this place exceeded my expectations by a mile. I'm so glad that I live within walking distance from this place and will definitely be ordering more! If you live in LIC, give them a call for sure :) you won't be disappointed"

You have to go to the side door, which is a steel door with no window which leads down a short stairwell to right where the kitchen is. While pickup was confusing, the tasty food made up for it. All the dishes were very solid, with no duds in this bunch (in order of preference): dukbokki with cheese, soondubu jjigae, fried chicken combo (drums and wings), japchae, bulgogi dupbap and kimbap.The dukbokki with cheese was my favorite. A little sweet, a little spicy, a little tangy; a balance of flavors that makes you to want go back for another bite. The rice cakes were the short, thin, cylinder type and were soft but with a some chew. The mozzarella cheese is extra but so worth it. Also was impressed with the soondubu jjigae. The perfect spice level, full flavored and bodied. Better than some of the soondubu jjigaes I have had at dedicated SDB joints.The fried chicken is also very good. The wings are more crunchy and the larger drumsticks are super moist. I ordered wayyy too much chicken so froze some. Both wings and drumsticks were still good after a brief stint in the oven, the drumsticks were just as moist as days before. The sweet and spicy sauce is gochujang based and was a good alternate to the soy garlic. Japchae was solid, not too salty, plenty of mushrooms but doesn't seem to come with meat unless you add it. The kimbap were well made and fine - my recent visit to Nolbu Sushi my have factored into how I felt about their kimbap since Nolbu was really good. No complaints about the bulgogi dupbap, not too sweet but could use a little more bulgogi and a little less rice. Did feel like this place was a little more pricey than other places but may be forgivable since it is hard to find an all around good Korean joint in the area that can do multiple dishes well."

Not only is this the first Korean restaurant I'm aware of in the LIC Court  Square/Hunter's Point area, but it's actually, truly legitimate Korean! With no exaggeration, I can say it belongs with the best you can find in Ktown. I ordered the fried chicken, rice cakes (+ cheese, which is a trend now), japchae, and seafood pancake. Admittedly, my expectations weren't that high, but the food was top-notch. In addition, they threw in some covid freebies with our delivery and a little handwritten thank you note, which is strangely heartwarming.  100% recommend this new haunt in the neighborhood."

We got one spicy pork kimbap - then had a hell if a time finding the place! Although it's technically on Crescent, the entrance (at least for now due to Covid???) is around the corner. Talk about under the radar! Buzz the buzzer and you will descend into a bunker like industrial kitchen. The staff was very friendly and accommodating, the food was beautiful AND incredibly delicious - by far the best kimbap we have had. Plus they included a cute note and free moon pie! We are very much looking forward to a return trip to sample a wider variety of items. Well worth the trip!"

I live in manhattan so the prices of Lim's kitchen's korean food are so much more affordable than Ktown.  The food was amazing and the delivery was fast! I got the fried chicken (spicy 2 and soy garlic). Both of which were fantastic. Also got the ddeokbukgi and kimbap. I think all of their prices are very reasonable and the quality of the food is very high. Would recommend going/ordering from here for delicious, reasonably priced Korean food."

My husband and I found our new go to Korean place. Living in Astoria, we tried the few Korean options but still missing good traditional cuisine. Thanks to a Grubhub search during coronavirus, this LIC gem came up and so glad we tried it. Kimchi Jigae was spicy and fatty, kimchi bokeumbap was tasty and comforting (could have been a little spicier for our taste), tuna kimbap was fresh with sweet takuan. Chicken wings were a little disappointing considering that's where the bulk of the great reviews concentrated on. We ordered 10 wings but came as a combo, no big deal so my husband can try it but the drumsticks had a bit too much fried breading and not enough soy garlic sauce. Not a deal breaker, just didn't expect it. But the best part, they taped a thank you note on a free soda can with Happy Easter. So kind! Will be ordering again and excited to tell my Umma about it!**UPDATE** 1 week laterOrdered here again and so thrilled this place exists. I could order the kimchi jigae everyday and my husband ordered the budaejigae this time and loved it. The ramen was packaged separately so it wouldn't get too soft in transit. Food was piping hot when it arrived. There was even some banchan included. The person delivering was so kind and thankful we ordered from them. And they left another note on a free soda and I burst out in tears. If you want comforting delicious korean food with kind owners, please order from here."

On top of the good food, I had a couple of small dishes and a soda added in free of charge, although I'm unsure whether that was because of the situation or because they were just that generous!

As we scrolled through the menu, we added sodduk (rice cake + sausage skewer) and kimbap because they just looked so so good and we were hungry sooo why not right lol. The two flavors of the boneless chicken were neatly partitioned in the box, with just the right balance of flaky and tender and crispy and all things that Korean chicken is :') Sauce was good, and not too overwhelming so you can actually still experience the texture of the chicken. We shared a small and (along with the other food we got) there was still a bit left over so I think if you're eating by yourself a small should be more than enough. Sodduk was very good, but unfortunately due to the delivery time the rice cake parts had hardened a little bit. While I initially thought it was a bit salty, that actually made it a perfect pairing with the kimbap. Much appreciated and I was personally pleasantly surprised at how thicc the roll was! yeet Delivery was estimated at about an hour, and our place is a bit isolated lol so we were just like chill about it but the food arrived about 30 minutes after I had ordered and they called to confirm my address and also to check on if I had any delivery requests re: the covid situation so I very much appreciated that! Definitely will be ordering again for quality of food and service :) a local business I'd love to see ~flourish~ even more!"

The radishes were crisp, Kimbap not soggy, the jigae wasn't too salty and the cucumber kimchi was delicious. We got two kimbaps, spicy udon stir fry, jiggae, and boneless Chicken.

The chicken mojo was flavorful, guac and chips provided the perfect side and the sangritas were punchy. My only regret was not ordering dessert.

The drinks are SO GOOD. It was a bit of a wait but so worth it. I'd go on a really nice day so you wouldn't mind the standing outside to enjoy some fresh air. The majority of the drinks were unfortunately sold out when i came but still i enjoyed what i had. I had the froze rosé on the rocks. And my bf had the sangria one. Soooo good. They definitely know how to make a good drink lol. The process can be a TAD bit confusing but you'll be fine. One like for ordering and then another for when your order is ready. They're pretty orderly. I'd absolutely go back to try more drinks. Oh and i had the calamari appetizer and it was SO GOOD.

First time around we stopped by for brunch they do offer a brunch menu & some frozen drinks I had the Watermelon Frose this was good nice taste, also tried the Frozen Sangria another great drink & the Watermelon Margarita was not bad. Appetizers tried the Beef Empanadas, very good w a nice dipping sauce. Main dish I had the Chimi Burger yumm great flavor to the meat, nice tasting bread & combo had it with a small salad not bad good dressing. Hubby had the Salmon with rice, salad & maduros good dish as well. Second time around stopped by for happy hour so glad the frozen drinks are part of it, great Frozen Sangrias. Appetizers we tried the Corn I must say very good.. Also tried the Chimi sliders instead of bread it comes on tostones not a bad idea,  good ""slider"".Another time regular dinner menu I gave the Jumpin Lomo a try u have Angus beef stir fried with tomatoes & onions comes with garlic rice & truffle fries, decent rice really good truffle fries specially mixed with the sauce from the meat. Hubby had the Pulled porky , nice tasting pork good combo with the rice, maduros & beans. For dessert we gave the Flan a try , great tasting flan with the coconut flavor. Glad this place was open during Quarantine, they had a good set up that ran smoothly we placed a take out order got the Chimichuri chicken & the Pulled Porky both came with rice , Maduros &  beans. Meat for both the Chicken & Pork were good decent rice & Maduros , the beans not good had no flavor. We were disappointed with the serving portion for take out , one scoop of rice on a $16 dollar dish not the best. We also got Frozen drinks to go those were great. Nice looking place 2 floors, simple yet nice decor with some Latin flavor, good music playing. Regular dinning so far has been a good experience , take out ahh depends how badly u want them drinks. Great during happy hour specially for drinks , price wise not terrible but it can add up quickly , we have enjoyed the drinks & food so far & will continue to visit from time to time."

Why do you need my order 4 times from my to still not put it in? The lack of competence was overwhelming. Yeah he compensation for this was an offer of one free drink. I don't have another 2 hours to wait. Never had this happen at any restaurant.UPDATE: they call me after 2 hours and 50 minutes to offer me a free shot after 4pm on Thursday. Smack in the face with beyond minimal effort.

I must say this restaurant has fully executed all the rules mandated by the CDC which makes this restaurant safe to order take out from.  I saw a sign in the window honoring First Responder and Senior Citizens and that stole my heart.

I got there and the guy by the door asked for my full name ( not sure why) then I showed him my email about the order been ready he said make the line and wait. Line? ... of 20 people waiting. Are you for real? It was raining it was windy. I left the line.My question to the place: why am I ordering something and I have to wait twice. I waited the 50mins and now I needed to wait in the line? For what? My order should've been ready. Ughh.. the system for take out is so disorganized. Not good for business

The first time I came for dinner with my cousins. We were a smaller group and our waitress was friendly but kind of slow. We were fine with it because the restaurant was still pretty new so we figured she just needed to get the hang of it. She messed up on our drink order but still let us keep the incorrect one. However, the second time I came with a bigger group for a friend's birthday and the waitress was slower than last time seemed annoyed anytime my party asked for anything.I find the guacamole to be a little bland - the price at $10 is not bad considering it comes with regular tortilla chips and plantain chips but I've had wayyy better so it's a pass for me. The fried calamari was very crunchy and came with 2 dipping sauces which were both really goood! The first time I went I had the lomo salteado which was very salty and the fries at the bottom were super soggy - I couldn't even finish the dish. The second time around I tried the Latino fried rice and it was delicious! I cleaned my dish which is rare for me. Everyone else seemed to like their dishes (including the salmon, arroz con pollo and churrasco) and there were no complaints. The drinks are also really good. Hopefully the staff is better trained but I can definitely see myself coming back for dinner and drinks."

We had the corn al diablito which is their version of Mexican corn which was delicious. The guac and plaintain chips is a great starter for your meal and the arroz con pollo was full of flavor and tender. I recommend getting the frozen margaritas which come in several flavors and also the moscow mule. Will definitely dine here again.

Mojo Chicken and Wagyu Chimi Sliders. The order page said the menu was only available from 10a-3:15p (it was 7pm), but it went through anyway. Food arrived 15 minutes before the Yelp estimate. The chicken was moist and the sauce was rich and tangy. The sliders were nice too, though I'd prefer a regular bun to the single piece of tostone per slider."

The group of 9 had reservations for 6:30pm. We were seated upstairs at a large table at exactly 6:30pm.The hostess, waitress and other staff were extremely friendly. The first time I came here, I got the arroz con polo which was decent but I felt as though it lacked flavor. This time around, I tried the pernil - don't expect this pernil to taste like your grandma made it. I find the food to be exactly what is promoted ""a Latin experience"". Happy hour was until 7pm ($5 drafts+wine, $6 Frozen drinks, $7 flavored drinks, i think).Mojo puts a nice twist to Latin food. I wouldn't say the food is enriched with flavor or mouth-watering but it's decent for the price and ambiance. The happy hour drinks were delicious! I got the frozen margarita - classic for $6, i believe. It was strong and really good!This location was once a different eatery - if you're from Queens, you know what i'm talking about. It's amazing how the owners of this establishment designed it beautifully!! Great for special occasions, dates or regular degular lunch/dinner/dranks. Dinner and Happy Hr dranks worked out to about $460.00 with gratuity and taxes included. I think that's pretty good for the service, food and overall ""Latin Experience""."

The rice wasn't fully cooked through- I can only assume the establishment was quite busy and going through the rice quickly without allowing it to be fully cooked through.

Friday night me and my colleagues wanted a drink so I suggested we visit this location to support small open business during the pandemic  of the COVID:19. The drink menu was informative and eye catching. I really wanted to try one of the signature drinks which was the Pink Flamingo or the Rosa Azul. They had a small range of drinks flavors to choose from, unfortunately the signature drinks weren't available. Suck to be me at the moment after I suggesting this spot to my colleagues. So I didn't fuss and just purchase the Big Boy Green Lantern since not other size was available for purchase. I felt force to purchase a big boy drink since they claim to not have small cups available. When we received our Big Boy drinks we realized the logo of our drinks weren't on our Big Boy container. False advertising since the menu shows the logo on all Big Boy drinks. I was disappointed and over it. Then when I got to my car I realized the cashier over charger me she added tortilla chips to my bill and I never asked for tortilla  chips for $2.00."

Also, the Latino rice felt like it was missing so much of the Latino flavor, it tasted really bland to us."

We arrived here on a Sunday night for a few drinks before  the long work week. We decided to get mojitos which were an excellent choice. Both the passion fruit and the coconut were so good. I highly recommend the coconut! Appetizers: we got the guacamole, a little spicy but I love spice. We got a side of sweet plantains which were perfect to settle the spice. We also got the skirt steak skewers with yuca frita, the yuca was delicious. This is a great place to grab some drinks at anytime if you're looking for a delicious cocktail.

I tried to keep this place a secret until it was my hunny's birthday. Earlier in the day I dropped off a cake from Martha's Country Bakery at Mojo so that I could surprise my hunny with it after we finished dining. I have to say that the Mojo staff were not only accommodating, but also understanding of me wanting his night to be perfect. I initially had a reservation at 7pm for two, but his mom and brother wanted to take him out also so I changed the reservation to 7:30pm for a party of four. We were seated upstairs where our waitress gave us ample amount of time to make our decision.We started off with apps and drinks which consisted of Moscato, Watermelon Frozé, and a La Amazonica. My hunny's La Amazonica was too strong for me. The Watermelon Frozé was bomb.com. I love frozen drinks. It tasted like a watermelon jolly rancher slushy. I definitely recommend trying it as it is one of their strongest frozen drinks. For our apps we ordered Tostones and Frituras Del Mar. I'm not sure how the tostones turned out but they were finished before I was able to take a picture. Our Frituras Del Mar app was on the smaller side and looked like a dish for one person, maybe a dish for two if you don't have much of an appetite. Certainly not a dish that can be easily served amongst four people. The Frituras Del Mar was okay but can be vastly improved if the dish was cooked a little longer. The batter was lightly fried which didn't provide the crunchiness I was longing for. I'm a huge fan of pickled onions but it didn't add much flavor to the dish, however it was aesthetically pleasing to the eye. The green sauce was amazing. I didn't care for the tartar sauce. Our entrees consisted of the Jumpin' Lomo, Churrasco, and Latino Fried Rice. My hunny and I both enjoyed our Churassco. We ordered our skirt steak medium which came out perfectly cooked. The garlic rice was really good. My only gripe is that the beans did not come out with our dish. I mentioned the missing beans to our waitress. She brought our beans out momentarily. His brother enjoyed his Jumpin' Lomo, but stated that the dish became salty towards the end of his meal. He also said that the portions could've been bigger -- I totally agree. His mom stated that the dish tasted rank and that the meat didn't taste as if it was cleaned properly. I'm not sure what their meals tasted like but the guys finished their meals. His mom and I ended up taking the rest of our meals home. Our waitress was kind enough to provide a sparkler for my hunny's birthday cake and even went as far as singing Happy Birthday to him with a few of her coworkers.I give Mojo a solid 3.5 stars."

They helped me arrange when to pop the question and even gave me ideas, they really made this experience better than I imagined. So major 5 star for the service!  Now let's talk about the food; must say everything we ordered from our pre fix menu was very satisfying. Not only did I enjoy my veggie fried rice but my guest enjoyed their orders too. The food was seasoned very well and the price was great. $50 for family style appetizers, entree, dessert and one alcohol beverage. Overall I recommend this place for big parties and if you're planning a special event. For big parties just keep in mind, you will be dealing with the venue planner via email, but do not worry they are very efficient with their responses. Please visit this establishment!"

The ambience is very trendy. There are table seating upstairs. It was a fun vibe for a Friday night.K and I met a friend here for dinner. We shared the following.Guac and Chips- classic good appetizer. Guac was smooth. The chips were plantains and crunchy.Wagyu Chimi Sliders- The beef was tender and little too well done. The green plantains were soft. I liked the sauce for this dish.Pernil with fried plantains and rice- the pernil was juicy when we started but drier as it sat. The fried plantains were good.Jumpin Lomo- stir fried sirloin cubes with truffle fries. This was one of the best entrees- so much beef juices in the rice and over the crunchy fries. It was so good! Macho Marino- shrimp, squid, fish, bay scallops in sofrito sauce. The sauce was so creamy, oceanic and flavorful! The scallops were wonderful! This was a great entree!Dessert:Choco Churros- Crunchy finger-long churros dusted with cinnamon sugar with chocolate hazelnut dipping sauce. This was great! The churros were fresh and crunchy. I loved the rich chocolatey sauce.Mango Tango- Mango mousse between layers of filo dough- essentially a mango Napoleon. This was my favorite dessert! So crunchy and the mousse was fluffy and light. The mango flavor was mild. Cookies and Cafe- Shortbread caramel cookies with ice cream. The shortbread cookies were so light and fluffy. The cookies were the best part! I loved it.Thank you Eli for the excellent service! Our waiter was fun and energetic! We had a great time!I would reorder Jumpin Lomo, Macho Marino and Mango Tango."

I loved the ceviche here - the Down the Hatch was Peruvian style, filled with little corn nuts, raw fish, shrimp, squid, cooked calamari, and plantains. The lime mixture was a little on the sour side but it was pretty authentic. The steak and eggs were really good - made with thin skirt steak and chimichurri sauce. The avocado tostadas weren't bad but missing a bit of a flavor. The happy hour here is bomb. I got frozen sangria for only $6 and it was awesome!!! The coffee here is also very good as mentioned earlier by another reviewer. Glad to have another solid brunch spot and fohi."

The guac has a significant lime flavor to it that makes it stand out above other guacamoles I have tried. Not much of a fan of the popcorn kernels in the chips but I know some people enjoy it. I usually get their passion fruit margarita on the rocks since I really like that they make it with fruit purée instead of flavored syrup. I loved getting the chicken mojo here but the last few times I have tried it I feel as though the consistency of the sauce has been too thick & creamy, and lacked the original flavor that initially caught my attention."

We honestly couldn't decide what we were in the mood for so we decided to munch on appetizers. Wagyu Chimi Sliders $14 (Delicious!!- a lot smaller than expected but so good with the sauce) Camarón Toast $14 (very good!) Spanish Kebabs $13 (if you are stuck between this appetizer and another one, get the other one! This portion was way smaller than expected, the yuca fries were drowned in unnecessary oil, it was not bad but not up to standards with the other two apps I tried, it was okay, try it if you must lol)Truffles Fries $7 (good for fries, does not come w the cheese flakes on top) Pitcher of White Sangria $30 (Delicious! Great portion. I say it would serve a total of 6 glasses) Total after taxes was $84.91, spent $100 after tip.Also, the restaurant was very clean, there was a bus  boy doing his thing, bathroom was cute and clean!

We ordered the frituras de mar for starters, which consisted of fried shrimp, calamari, and catfish. It was hitting. We also ordered the Camaron toast with some wine of our choice. Note: they have a fairly decent selection. We decided to share the blood orange salmon and that too was really really good. I'm still thinking about it days later lol. I def recommend coming here the food is good, not too loud, trendy, the only downfall is where it's located parking is so hard. If you're in the neighborhood check it out.

Turns out, after waiting for my food, it appears to be fairly kid-friendly and had a decent noise level. Gorgeous restaurant inside. Kitchen opens at 5PM for dinner. A bit of a wait but the food was mega fresh. Wagyu Chimi Sliders - it's beef on a tostone (fried plantain). Delicious! Great flavor combo. I liked it with and without the sauce. Still pretty good and fresh considering it was take out.Spanish kebabs - oh my, the beef was perfect! The yuca fries were the best yuca fries I have ever had. Perfect crunch on the outside and well-cooked yuca on the inside. Yuca can be a challenge to cook but it was executed well here. Chicken mojo - The sauce on the chicken breast was divine. Loved the garlic rice, really kicked it up a notch and added so much flavor to the meal. Asparagus and black beans were standard.Latino fried rice - decided to try this based on other reviews. Unique twist on fried rice. I like that they added pieces of sweet plantains. Good flavor in this. My kids really enjoyed it.Jumpin' lomo - another delicious meal! The beef was just right, rice was on point, fries were soaked up with flavor - overall a great dish.I was really pleased and happy with all the food here. Best part was that everyone said it wasn't heavily salted so you don't need to guzzle a gallon of water afterwards. Great flavor, fresh food and good service. Can't ask for more. Although one gripe is that it's a bit pricey (all this was just under $100) but for a special occasion, it's worth it."

I really love that they don't play  any bachata or reggaeton;  but I'm sure  that will eventually change because there is no new salsa music out there and you want to provide a new vibe or experience for returning customers .Menu: They light up and I love that extra touch! For the appetizer I had the Wagyu Chimi Sliders that were absolutely juicy and great tasting . So much so that , I didn't really think twice about the shrimp toast that was also ordered.The main dish was the skirt steak which was also very good, well cooked, well seasoned and juicy!

We got the chips and guacamole and the corn al diablito both super good. Desert was also very nice. The reason for my 4 stars is because of the entree.

Yelpers, you led me astray on this one!We came in a rainy day, so it wasn't too crowded, which was great. We got the menus - which light up, by the way! - and saw that the price range was typical for Forest Hills (though I will never understand why entrees are that much, but that's for another conversation). I ordered the Macho Marino ($26) and it was different. The description says: Seared fish in a savory shrimp, calamari and bay scallop sofrito bisque. Served with yuca and garlic rice. The bisque was great - but I was surprised to find the yuca ... in the bisque? From the description, it sounded like it came as a side. But anyways, it was fine, just different.What was not fine, though, was the rice. It was microwaved. I know this because the rice was crunchy.Rice should not be crunchy.But there were a lot of things that happened that shouldn't have happened.- My friend and I ordered the same entrée. His dish came out, mine did not. Only until I asked our waitress about where my dish was (we waited about 5 mins after his dish came out).- My entrée came with rice. His did not. And when we asked about his rice, his rice suddenly came with scallions, which mine didn't have.- Then we realized that I had a spoon for my bisque, and he did not. And when we asked for the spoon, it was a different spoon from what I had gotten (he got a tea spoon, I got a soup spoon).It was all these little things that just stuck out to us and had us asking - what is happening? - several times during our dinner.- Another friend ordered the Chicken Mojo ($22) and that chicken was so dry on the inside - and again, microwaved rice!- We also ordered tostones ($5) as a side and that was good within the first 30 seconds. It was immediately cold after that.And we ordered a pitcher of sangria - just do yourself a favor if you're planning on drinking sangria in Forest Hills - don't. No one in the area apparently knows how to make it correctly. This one was the same as Cabana - too sweet. We ended up adding so much water to it and just not finishing it because it wasn't worth the potential cavities.We paid so much only for us to not enjoy our meal. I'm still reading the other 4+ stars reviews and am still in shock that my friends and I didn't have the same great experience. No recommendations."

I ordered the calamari and the truffle feta fries... calamari:good batter still crunchy and not to hard. They substituted the marinara for a salsa verde.ok I like... but only 4 bites, then I want my marinate. The ***YUCCA**fries on the bottom or this plate though....... were awesome. So little seasoning or effort needed but these yucca fries were delicious. FRIES: didn't like them I would have needed more feta on as a topping and more melted. I think it too much Greek flair for a Latin spot..I suggest a beef option empanadaOh and classic margarita; sugar on the rim **effin awesome**"

The waiter could have been a bit more attentive given the fact it was not super busy but it's all good. I would have given 5 stars if they brought out chips to wait for the food with. The food was good, tasted fresh. Priced a bit high for the portion given. All in all a good experience but there wasn't anything on the menu that stood out. This was more of ""our plans fell through and this place was close"" rather than ""Wow I'm really looking forward to trying this spot"". A tasty place for some comfort food!"

I bought one last week on Wednesday for $15.  Along with Latino Fried Rice. Food was great. So I came back on a Saturday and the line was down the block. A testament to the popularity of their huge drinks. I stand in line & place my order at 3:57 pm. The drink has gone from $15 to  $20 now. They ask me to wait in my car. And they will text me. I continue to wait for a text. A hour goes by, I say hey I haven't got my text. ""Sorry were busy"" 2 hours go by , I only ordered rice!  I go up to them & demand a credit.  Finally get my food. And guess what. It sucked. Rice had way too much garlic. They must've hired a new cook. I was so upset I didn't even sip on my frozen drink & saved it for later. Bottom line. I get raising your prices by a dollar or two. But $5!!! That's price gouging during uncertain economic times. That's horrible and taking advantage because everyone else is charging $15.  If your gonna raise prices , then you should provide quality customer service.  I'm not going back..ever. I'll take my business elsewhere. Just wanted to provide a warning to everyone. They finally did text me. 4 hours later ‍"

I drove 40 mins from LI to Queens & was served with raw meat ! (Ofcourse I didn't find out until I drove all the way back home.) I called in the order while on my way to the restaurant and didn't get the text that it was ready until I was just parking out front. 40 mins for RAW steak ? Thank god I called in advance but what does it matter if your food still is half way cooked I ordered the Churrasco with Shrimp order it came with white rice and sweet plantains. 1. The meat was raw. (Manager explained that they cook their steak at medium temperature which would make the middle red.) & that I didn't state the temperature I wanted my steak to be cooked at. I asked him why the employee who took my order didn't ask me ""how would you like your steak cooked?"" And just assume that everyone likes raw meat. 2. The rice is not ""latin"" rice. It had no seasoning at all it tasted bland.3. The beans looked like they were put in a bowl of water and soaked, what type of gravy would that give my rice ?4. The baby sized shrimps that comes with the meal are not worth extra money. 5. The only thing DECENT about this meal was probably the maduros except my boyfriends plate had 3 pieces and I had 2. Are they just throwing shit in a dish? How many maduros are supposed to come with the order ? 2 or 3Upon calling the manager I was told I couldn't receive a full refund bc he would need the food back. & as you can probably tell I wasn't gonna drive another 40 mins there and 40 mins to get back home to return this garbage. When I expressed to the manager that I invested my time and money to come SUPPORT them and that I needed a full refund he rudely told me that the time it took me to get to his restaurant is not his problem and the only thing he can do is a half refund. This is a mistake I will NEVER make again. This was clearly a rushed order due to the high call volume during corona virus, you'd think people would put more love and care into the food their serving ESPECIALLY IN SUCH HARD TIMES. (When i stated this to the manager he started bragging about how they've been giving free food to hospitals and trying to praise their brand) but when you view their Instagram stories they only have posts of reposting ppl who tagged them in their drink orders. If you're actually ""helping"" ppl how am I being denied a full refund on horrible service ? He also said ""I hook people up all the time who are a little more patient with me"" when I became upset that I was getting only half my money back. How do you want a customer to be patient for receiving raw food ? Supposed I got food poisoning would that warrant me a full refund ? Every logical point I stated was answered with a snarky response and this is not the way customer service is supposed to be!    I am unsatisfied with this restaurant this is my first & will be my last time going here.Also they have a IG post saying the big boys are $15 but when you get to the restaurant they still charge you $18 that would've made my 2 drinks with 2 extra shots at $3 each $42.. I was charged $45. When I went back in to ask about the IG post they said it was an old post but yet that post never specified that it was for that day only or for a limited time only. I drove 40 mins out, came home with raw food was overcharged, and STILL had to cook my raw steak at home so I didn't waste my money. Thanks for a horrible experience & your take on ""representing"" latin culture"

I've been to Mojo a few times since they opened and tried something new each time. The Mojo Chicken is my favorite, the sauce it comes with is delicious.

The only reason I docked a star is because whenever I've gone I've gotten the skirt steak. Both times I've asked for medium and both times I've received it very well done. It was still yummy, but a little chewier than I wanted. Other than that, no complaints. The ambiance is nice, and in the summer the doors are open so you feel like you're dining outside. They used to have a spicy margarita or some frozen spicy drink which was awesome but they got rid of it because many people did not like it. If you like spicy margaritas like I do, the bartender will mix in jalapeño oil to spice it up."

Overall, it's a great spot to just grab drinks and eat good food with your friends! There could be a little bit of a wait but you can leave your number and they can text you once your table is ready! You don't wait too long since they have 2 floors of seating.For starters, we had the chicharron buns, which is probably the highlight of the meal. Highly recommend!! The chicharron was crispy on the outside and juicy/tender on the inside. Also got the chicken taquitos, which were really enjoyable as well! For the entree we shared the jumpin' lomo which is the sirloin cubes. The dish was a bit on the salty side, but still pretty decent. The drinks were tasty too. I recommend getting one of their frozen drinks! I had the frozen mango margarita. Service was really slow unfortunately, which is why I'm bumping it down from 4 to 3 stars. It took us a very long time to order since our waitress was taking care of so many tables by herself. We tried getting the attention of other workers, but we were instructed to wait for our specific server. However, our waitress apologized and I totally understand that it can get hectic. Definitely recommend hiring more help, so that they can satisfy the customers' needs more efficiently, especially at night on weekends."

So creamy and rich and perfectly sprinkled with edible flowers.  The steamed broccolini side was surprisingly good (I just ordered it to be healthy and expected it to taste whatever - but it was one of my faves!).  The wagyu sliders were decent (my least favorite but just as delicious).ORDER THE MANGO TANGO DESSERT! I was ready to lick my plate clean and my husband reminded me I'm in a public setting (OOPS).Although a little pricier than my usual takeout.  I would definitely come back here again - this time with friends.  Give this place a chance!

The decor and ambiance is definitely what I would classify as modern, with dark hardwood floors and tables, tablecloths, some modern artwork adorning the walls, artwork adorning the walls, and so forth. I was a bit taken aback by the stones in the restroom sink; it just strikes me as trying too hard.Our waitress was extremely attentive, refilling my coffee and my friend's without us having to flag her down. Considering we chug coffee like water at brunch, that is some great attentiveness.Per the waitress' recommendation, I had the Chilaquiles Verdes, which she described as ""kind of like nachos."" I really enjoyed it; it was heavily sprinkled with cilantro and they certainly did not skimp on the Oaxaca cheese. I was mildly disappointed with the portion size, but at least for this dish, it's denser than it looks and the concave dish contributed to that. If you are looking for portion size / bang for your buck above all else, there are diners located in along Austin St. that are better suited.My friend got the avocado tostada and liked it as well; a nice Hispanic take on the stereotypical hipster ""avocado toast"" that aging boomers use to make fun of younger people. He mentioned that the roasted sunflower seeds it contained gave it a nice crunch on top of the fried corn tortilla.I can also confirm that the coffee is definitely high quality and they have free refills as of the time of this review. No free refills of coffee means I do not dine at your restaurant for breakfast or brunch. It's coffee, not mimosas, Bloody Marys, or wine; it's NYC so it may be hard, but please don't nickel-and-dime people.So yes, I definitely like this place, for it's a definite change of pace from my usual haunts, where I pride myself on finding places that seem like they were yanked from their respective countries and dropped right here in New York City. The brunch here is quite good, I have not tried them for dinner, but I probably will be doing that soon. However, I cannot help but be flabbergasted at $10 ""gluten free chips and guacamole"" appetizer, because due to my previously mentioned habits, I know plenty of places where I can get a full meal at a sit-down restaurant for less than that. Sure, they aren't trendy and the bathrooms are usually about as cramped as one on a passenger jet... but I'm there for the food, not the trendy decor."

It didn't go well. To keep the story short my friend and I sat at the bar and order a round of cocktails - they we Good -  on my first visit the mojito was way too sweet - thinking its batched and made in large quantities.We both order the vegan ceviche and a guacamole and chips - our ceviche order came out incorrectly - they gave us a mango salad - which we were thrown off by but it was descent tasting and we were hungry so we ate it - halfway through eating it the bartender tells us it's the wrong plate and that the ceviche was coming out - we appreciate that he was honest and corrected it but then the ceviche came out and it looked nothing like a ceviche. One of the owner was by the bar and we spoke to him for a bit and I told him my feedback but he brushed it away. Feedback in any business is very important- if a customer is going out of the way to give you information so that you can improve - be receptive and appreciate it - don't knock it down and give excuses. Just turned off by the owners attitude more than the food itself - prices are high and the expectation of the customers experience should be high as well. I do appreciate that they have vegan options but - don't call something a ceviche that doesn't look anything like one. Ps : vegan ceviche is super easy to make - just YouTube it

First, with this entire chaos that is going on we need to be united and instead most businesses are being greedy and false advertising and price gauging their items. I am a regular at Mojo I go there all the time for brunch, lunch and dinner so I am pretty familiar with prices. There have 2 instances already where I have been charged for items I did not order and thankfully I ALWAYS check my bill. I let that go because I understand people make mistakes but sometimes I believe its done on purpose. Nevertheless, they have an advertisement all over social media stating 50% off take outs now it does not specify exclusions. When I go to pick up the order now the whom I think is the owner says "" you know its not on beverages"" now Of course I had to look again and it is crystal clear it does not state exclusions. He was pretty nasty and boldly says I need to make money and stay afloat! of course so does every other business in NYC. I understand small businesses are struggling but do you think by false advertising and being disrespectful to your customers is going to get you to make money. For every customer you treat disrespectfully you lost 10 more because that person will tell their friends and so forth to take business elsewhere. BE HONEST with people and don't false advertise and then be rude when people question YOUR advertisement! Trust me customers check your receipts always! they have a pretty bad habit to add "" extra items"" thinking you wont check it and they change prices when you order alot of beverages all of a sudden happy hour does not apply to certain drinks. SMH sad that they take advantage of customers.  Good luck Mojo"

We ordered one round of drinks to start and later another. We started with the Rosemary Pisco and Sabor A Mi. Both were absolutely delicious! I don't remember the names of our second round of drinks but we liked the first choices we went with more.For appetizers we shared the guacamole and the ceviche. We loved the unique flavor and presentation of both (the guacamole was more smooth rather than chunky how it usually is and the ceviche was served in a nice glass). For entrees we ordered the Jumpin Lomo and Macho Marino. All the food was delicious and service was great. We will definitely be back again for dinner and drinks. We are so happy this place opened up in this area.(My only minor comment is that it did take a bit longer than you'd think for our appetizers to come out.

This place was packed (as expected). Our servers were very helpful getting us seating and offering suggestions. Overall, we loved the flavor in the dishes, the plating of the dishes, and the ambiance. Starting with the new renovated look of the place (we remember how it looked as Exo Cafe), the colors of all the restaurant are a mix of wood, white, and earth tones, with the accommodation of floral mid-century accents. The chairs were comfortable and matched the tables nicely. We admired the aesthetics of the restaurant throughout our meal.Now on to the food. We stopped by just for drinks and appetizers, which started with frozen margaritas. We had the passion fruit ones, which were great. And our appetizers were the Wagyu Sliders, Spanish Kebabs and Chicken Taquitos.The Taquitos were my girlfriend's favorite part. The taquitos were mouth watering and juicy. They had the perfect balance of spice and her favorite avocado. The Sliders were my favorite, the housemade pink sauce that layered the bottom of them complemented the tender meat with sweet and savory flavor. We enjoyed the Spanish Kebabs as well (comes with 3 kebabs and 3 yuca fries), I always love Yuka fries and the meat was delicious.Lastly, we ate the Churros with Chocolate and Strawberry Sauce. We LOVED the chocolate and strawberry, it was absolutely decadent with the 4 churros.Overall, excellent place. Priced accordingly with the other Austin restaurants. Will definitely come back for Entrees next time. Check it out!"

My only complaint was that the chimichurri was very salty, the salt overlook the herbs. I would have also liked an element of heat, whether some jalepeno in the guacamole or some heat to the pickled onions or something. The dishes needed that to cut the richness. We had the churrasco and the pernil. Both were delicious. Sides included black beans, garlic rice (which was delicious) and maduros. The ambiance was great and there was definitely a calm that felt like a getaway from busy Austin Street. The food was great and the menu had some unique dishes on it. My steak was cooked to a perfect medium (usually if you order medium it comes out medium-well). Everything was very flavorful and great. Portions were excellent. The drink was appropriately strong. We will definitely be back."

They tasted strange, like not natural or something.  I think that it's a pre-packaged thing and they simply fry it at the restaurant and was a big disappointment. I got so excited when I first saw the plate and I saw them they incorporate a fry plantings to their chips and guac, I liked the combination but it was an epic fail  My friend and I ordered the same main course meal, Jumpin' lomo. The plate was good but I have had this meal in so many different restaurants, I know that it is a Peruvian plate and I think that they did OK. I am aware that they gave their own little twist to the recipe and that they also use another type of steak, I would say a better quality of meat than any other restaurant I have gone too. I have to say that I loved the atmosphere, they were playing great music, and the decoration of the restaurant is amazing, from the walls to the ceiling to the restroom... Amazing.

Overall, the food was ok and the service was great. FOOD (Rated: 3.5/5)Guac & Chips - While the chips were great, I've had MUCH better guacamole. This was watery instead of chunky and had way too much lime. Don't recommend getting. Sautéed Vegetables - This dish was just okay. Lacked in chimichurri sauce and also came with 1 spoon of quinoa on top of the veggies. If I had know that this dish did not come with quinoa, I would've ordered something else. Don't order unless you want to pay $17 and still be starving. Arroz con Pollo- My boyfriend ordered this and said it was just okay. The rice was flavorful but the chicken was a tad bit dry.

Hopefully I find a good entree to love, so I can keep coming back. The place has a great vibe! 3.5 stars, but to be continued..."

After waiting for over 40 minutes after putting out names down, my group of friends sat down to order drinks. We were told by our server that if we only ordered apps and a drink we would only get 45 minutes to sit and have our drinks. Fair enough, it's busy and it's policy. So to comply with this rule, my friends order appetizers I order an entree so we can actually sit and have time to eat our food instead of being rushed out right after getting it. We get our food, start eating and our server comes by to say we have 15 minutes left. We just look at her confused because we ordered an entree, and she this time clarifies no ""EACH PERSON"" need to order an entree, a complete lie because not everyone at the table next to us ordered an entree. When I ask her why she didn't clarify this when I ordered the overpriced tiny entree, she becomes belligerent and refuses to answer instead, instead repeating like a broken record ""it's policy"". To add insult to injury, on the bill they charge a nice, fat 20% party fee and gratuity, which clear states for parties of 6 or more, we were 5 people. Maybe because we looked like teenagers they thought it would be easier to get away with being so shady, or maybe our waitress couldn't count. All in all what a shady business practice, you don't even let us sit for more than 45 minutes when we have ordered over 100 dollars worth of food and drinks but you can happily charge the party and gratuity fee without batting an eye?? We had to chug the rest of our drinks and take the food to go to comply with their policy as well as give them the mandatory 20%. If you want a restaurant that will treat you like shit and send you packing before you can even finish your food and drink that you're paying for, but have no problem with overcharging you, you've found your place."

Drinks are on point and the food is so delicious. I had the Kobe sliders on the tostones , the garlic chicken in that creamy sauce ,the chicken taquitos and the empanadas with the Picadillo inside. Yes we went overboard and it was so worth it. The portion size is very good and I'm digging the prices. And FYI, The green tomatillo sauce is simple but banging. Yum! This place is my new favorite Cuban inspired place in forest hills."

Place has great decor the all day long happy hour Tuesday. Passion fruit mojito is a must try and the chicken  mojo is just simple and so damn flavorful. My husband had the Latino fried rice with the pork belly  and he loved it. Definitely will be coming back again.

We ordered a ceviche and it was good! However we also ordered a arroz con pollo, rice and chicken and the chicken was super cold, when you actually bite the chicken you can feel the cold in the middle, was quite disappointed, make me believe that they didn't cook the chicken right then. They should have the staff make sure they ask the customers how the food is."

I came here with my bff to finalize our big trip overseas and what better way to celebrate than over a meal and drinks. Let me start with the beautiful decor, which sets the stage for a summer evening. Sitting at a table with the doors open to the street as you sip on your fancy Strawberry Margarita and watch people pass by. As we enjoyed a few different Margaritas on the menu we ditched an appetizer and dug into their Aron con pollo and their Veggies dish. (See attached photos) The food came out quickly and everything was delicious. The chicken in the Aron con pollo was so tender and seasoned perfectly and sat on top of a bed of cilantro beer garlic rice, red bell pepper, green peas, green plantains and pico de gallo. I'm licking my lips just thinking about this dish and how good it was. Their sauteed veggies consisted of quinoa, roasted bell peppers, broccolini, cremini mushrooms, sweet potato, cherry tomatoes and asparagus seasoned in chimichurri. Which is all gluten free and vegan. It's great when a restaurant has these options on the menu. Our server was friendly and attentive. I'll definitely be adding Mojo to my rotation of 5 stars restaurants in Forest Hills."

I discovered this place not too far from our house and the experience was amazing !!! I was starving and we were sat immediately and asked for appetizers, drinks etc. It sucked because I didn't bring my ID for drinks, but my boyfriend loved his!!! They weren't cheap with the tequila in the drinks, so it was worth the 12 bucks per drink, so the drinks made this a five star. The appetizers were some of the best I had, the corn al diablo reminded us of Esquite and the empanadas were freshly fried and juicyyyyyy.  The main dishes we had were steak and the arroz con pollo and they were great!!! I wasn't too much of a fan for the arroz con pollo because the veggies were hard in the rice, but I will try something else next time. Churros for dessert were sooooooo good and fresh!!!! I was already stuffed because the plates are HUGE. We spent about $145 with tip so it was a pretty affordable place for two.  The server always came around, refilled drinks and always asked if we needed anything, so the service was very attentive!! Would totally recommend to latin food lovers. :)"

Dish was very nicely prepared also!! Decor was decent and and comfortable... I would recommend this place for Spanish dishes."

They made some interior changes and they do look really nice. the host greeted us upon arrival and we were sat on the second level. The waiter used an electronic tablet to take orders, oh yea and the menus are lit up as soon as you open them, for easy reading. We ordered two frozen margarita, flavored. They were cold, but they were very sweet. As for food we ordered guacamole and chips for an appetizer. When served it was mixed of plantain chips and tortilla chips with the guacamole. The guacamole was delicious but the chips, both of them, were really stale. I mentioned it to the waiter but honestly didn't get any reaction she just took away the plate. As for the main course we ordered pernil and jumping lomo. The dishes were flavorful and a good sized portion. To give the drinks another chance we ordered plain frozen margaritas. Yep they were still really sweet, we did not finish them. I guess it's a nice new place on Austin street, if you look real sweet drinks then this is your spot but the food was very good besides the stale chips"

The bar was full and lively and we were welcomed by both the bartender and a random hostess that was there to pick up drinks for her table . The drinks were really good. Each different and delicious and strong enough to give anyone a quick buzz. When we got seated we were taken care of by our server Eli who made us feel comfortable and was also very helpful on and informative. We ordered the blood orange salmon, the jumpin Lomo, the corn, and the S and S ceviche... The food was delicious and flavorful. I pretty much licked the plate clean. Matthew, the manager came by afterwards and greeted us and I couldn't help but commend him on how good the food was and that I was definetly coming back...The experience at Mojo today was very good and comfortable. The food was delicious. The drinks were amazing. The fact that there is a new Spanish restaurant that is trying to stand out and make a name for itself is awesome. Overall, I think this place great and can't wait to go back! Good luck to Matthew, Eli and the rest of the crew there on continued success!"

I think it's absolutely  disgusting and pathetic to price-gouge your customers during this pandemic. None of the other restaurants that I have ordered from have pulled this crap. Let me repeat that, NONE OF THE OTHER RESTAURANTS ARE PRICE  GOUGING THEIR CUSTOMERS!  Yet this place increased their prices and then the owner wants some sort of prize for staying open. Like really?!?!! Everyone else that's  open figured out how to keep prices the same. That's a scumbag move.  Scumbag companies will always find an excuse for why they are ripping off their customers. We don't need your excuses.   Time to support HONEST small businesses!"

I was provided 4 prefix menu options, an extended happy hour time just for my party & they even printed my customized menu for the table! The service was great & I returned two weeks later. My favorite dishes are the Arroz Con Pollo, Chicken Mojo & I've also tried the Jumpin Lomo. The coconut mojitos are amazing and the Guac YUM. A lovely place for casual dining or celebrations.The decor is chic & romantic. I've referred many people & I'll be visiting like tomorrow. Definitely a must try!"

This place brings me nostalgia of when I lived in Miami with authentic Cuban food. The chicken mojo is amazing!! Not an understatement... highly recommended. My mother ordered the pernil and she was amazed of how delicious and spot on they cooked the pernil. Clearly the latin fusion to the tee.. she said it was the best! My salute to the chef. Our waitress was one of the managers  catherine... she was super attentive, courteous and made us feel right at home. The passion fruit mojito also highly recommend... 1 turned to 2 and almost nonstop addicting! Thats how great it was. Ambience was great too..: authentic cuban  tunes that brought me back to missing my havana and miami nights!!!

We sat near bar area since it was a packed day. We had the steak & eggs which was seasoned very well.

We had a nice set up and fixed beautiful customized menu. The food was delicious and the place is gorgeous. The bar area is a title too small and it can get very crowded but it's worth it because the drinks are amazing. I do recommend this place for a large group event or simple dinner night out.

The music, the vibes, the food, the service...all of it. We started off with appetizers. We got guacamole and chips which was served with plantain chips, tortilla chips and pine nuts and the wagyu chimi sliders served on fried plantains with a homemade pink sauce. For our mains, we got the jumping lomo which was lomo saltado with garlic rice and truffle fries. We also got the pernil which was shredded pork with white rice, plantain chips and green plantains. We also got the macho marina which was a seafood dish with calamari, scallops and shrimp with yuca in a delicious sauce. For dessert we got the mango tango, a flaky pastry dessert with fruit, churros and chocolate and cookies with ice cream. Everything was amazing and our server Eli was the absolute best. He was super friendly and attentive. I really enjoyed my experience here and will come back and try their drinks and brunch."

Very latin yet updated. The frozen sangria was served right away, and it was awesome. The fried calamari/shrimp/fish trio was a hit, and the vegan ceviche was average, yet unconventional.

Always a good time from the great music and atmosphere to the great food and drinks and most of all the wonderful service. If you haven't visited yet you must make your way here you wont regret it. As far as food I love the S&S scallops and salmon ceviche that sauce is everything I literally want to lick the plate. I usually have the mule but the mojitos are great and to my surprise the sangria is delicious and $15 pitchers on Mondays is a steal! my new Monday spot for sure. And lastly the bathrooms are the best for selfies lol Wish them the best of luck and have gained me as a loyal customer that's for sure

I was extremely upset when Exo Cafe closed. It was one of my favorite places. I was not planning on liking Mojo as much as I did. I went for dinner with my mother, husband, and mother-in-law and every single dish that we ordered was absolutely delicious. My mother-in-law and I had the arroz con pollo. It was mouth wateringly good and a large portion. I had enough left over to take home. My mom got a vegetable dish and added shrimp to it. She enjoyed it very much. My husband had a pork dish that he was raving about too. The next night I went with a friend for drinks and everything was delicious. I will be back again"

I was a bit disappointed that it was a pre-fixed menu since I had my mind set on the ceviche and the options offered didn't seem to be anything out of the ordinary.  So we placed our order and were a bit turned off but once the food came out we were all pleasantly surprised with the flavor and the food portions.  The managers sent us over extra servings of the quinoa salad and the salmon appetizer that we didn't even think to try and we all enjoyed every bit of it.  I had my 8 month old in his stroller and the hostess went out of her way to make sure we were comfortable which I really appreciated since I'm new at this mom life. The waitress was very prompt and informative and the managers were friendly and accommodating.  They even had the first series of match ups for the world cup games on the big screens by the bar which was another surprise.  We were able to enjoy our dinner, frozes and got to see Uruguay win against Ecuador. We will definitely be back to try the ceviches and other entrees in the near future so we can give this establishment the full 5 stars.  Mojo's will definitely stay on my list of local spots to head over too!"

The staff are very welcoming, music is at a perfect volume where you can actually have a great conversation at brunch without yelling... My preferred plate is the salmon quinoa, as i am a pescatarian and they have great dishes for us here! The ceviche comes really pretty and tasty! The food is not salty whatsoever and the guacamole is very homemade and fresh! My friends ordered the Latino fried rice,  chicken mojo dish and the churassco ! They loved it... rice and beans where on point too! I even has some :)The FROZE IS OFFF THE CHAIN! They have a great selection of cocktails.. they even have one with eggwhites in it!

The decor is really nice, a good change from the previous restaurant. It was very cozy and had a good atmosphere. The service was decent, the hostess had no sense of enthusiasm or didn't seem to be very welcoming but the waiter was fine. I had two appetizers and my meal. The Spanish kebabs and the chicharron buns. I really enjoyed the chicharron buns, if you don't like the fatty parts then you with like it, and the yucca fries. My friend had the churasco. We both actually did not enjoy the steak from either of our meals. It did taste pretty bland. Although the meal wasn't 100%, we will visit again because the drinks were good and we just won't order the steak again."

The food is really tasty and we both enjoy the sangria that they make. While I prefer sangria to be stronger, I don't mind this one. Now, the food is the heart and soul of this place. I've ordered a few different entrees from the menu and it is really really good! Our most recent visit had a slight hiccup with our order taking forever to come but the manager comp'd our dessert in addition to speaking with us and apologizing. I want to have my birthday party here over the summer :)"

I liked Mojo, dont get me wrong.  My bartender was awesome,  and my happy hour margarita was powerful. However, my $14 appetizer--chimi sliders, i believe-- was tiny.

Service was great and so was the food and drinks. I had the passion mula drink and if u like passion fruit it's delicious. I had the chicken in the white sauce and ooooh my it was SO GOOD! & for dessert-those were probably the best churros I've ever had. Tasted hot and fresh. Will be coming back!

The restaurant was not overly crowded which is always an issue on holidays. Service was top notch, although I wish I remembered my servers name! He was attentive and thorough. I will be returning since I live fairly close, and I would love to try other items on the menu. And, more Frozè!!"

The place is beautiful, service was pretty good, they were playing old school Salsa which is my fav! I had a Sangrita which was pretty good. We had the Wagyu Chimi sliders for appetizer, and the Jumpin Lomo for dinner! The food was amazing although for the price I think they should serve a little more food, portions were very small, due to this we had space for dessert and decided to try the Churros they were delicious , always the perfect end to any dinner!"

I've been to a Mojo a few times and overall the service has been good but the food/drinks decent. On my most recent visit, I ordered frozen passion fruit margaritas, guacamole and chips and Latin fried rice with pork belly. The drinks had too much passion fruit syrup at the bottom of the glass (even after I asked them to put less in the second one) and weren't mixed well. The chips were VERY stale and needed more salt/seasoning, as did the guacamole that was drowned in micro green garnish. The rice and pork belly were salty but good. However, I got food poisoning from eating at this restaurant again and will not be returning."

CONS although they have high chairs I don't consider this place kids friendly.. no changing table in the bathroom for my friend's baby and they took looong time to prepare our table, between cleaning, setting it up and letting us go to it it took long time .. food itself took looong time. Although we had kindly requested  to bring the toddler food first and most urgently to avoid a meltdown.. def disappointing"

The decor is unique. We were greeted by the host when we walked in. Then we were seated upstairs. Our glasses were filled with water and we were given menus.  We ordered frozen red sangria and passion fruit mojitos. The drinks were awesome! The menus were cool as they light up. For the appetizers we ordered the Spanish kebabs and the chicharrón buns. FYI: they come in 3's  ...The Spanish kebabs were tender and juicy. The chicharrón buns were fresh, the pork belly was crunchy which great flavor! We went on to order the Latino fried rice and the Jumpin' lomo. The Jumpin'lomo was okay  nothing to brag about. The Latino fried rice was extremely salty it was not edible. I asked for it to be fixed but it still did not tickle my fancy. I still wanted to give this restaurant a chance so I ordered dessert and got the churros. The churros did not disappoint, sweet, crunchy and soft. The chocolate sauce went perfect with it."

And the food was pretty good nothing extraordinary spectacular. We waiting a while to be served and when we were served they said ran out out frozen margaritas.... how do you run out of ice at a big establishment Servicing so many drinks. We then ordered an appetizer and it never showed up to the table. Which is why I took off a star . But overall seemed to be a nice restaurant to go to."

The drinks were very good, we tried mojitos and frozen sangria. The bar area looks nice and I would definitely meet someone here for drinks. The food was ok, not as flavorful as I expected.  the guacamole appetizer portion served mostly chips but the actual guacamole portion was small to share, and was on the watery side as another review mentioned.  The corn Diablo was good, but a little too creamy and missed the roasted taste usually found with Mexican street corn."

Firstly, the ambiance and decor of the place is great. My friend and I ordered a Passion Mula and a Mojito and both were excellent. I definitely would recommend the Mula to anyone, it's my new favorite drink. We started with guac and chips - loved that it came with both tortilla chips and plantain chips, but the guac did have a LOT of onion which I wasn't completely a fan of. For my entree, I ordered the Churrasco which was cooked to perfection and I really liked the hint of garlic in the rice. Our server, Olivia, was fantastic and gave us a lot of recommendations and was always checking on us to make sure everything was to our liking. Will definitely be back!"

They have to work on some things. Hopefully they read the reviews and work on it. First of all the restaurant looks beautiful. Great decor.   We were seated upstairs.  The waitress we had was lovely. Very sweet. The floor manager or host was gracious.  Welcomed us with a big smile.  They have an unusual mixed cocktail menu. Very eclectic. I tried the one with the roasted pineapple. It was sweet but Delish. I tried a sample of the frozen rose.  It was disgusting. Had a bubblegum aftertaste. Even though rose is dry.  This drink was sickly sweet.  Thank god I asked to try it.  My second drink was a strawberry margarita.  Although strong ...it tasted off.  An aftertaste I can't put my finger on.  Me and my sister ordered the chicharron burger and two Medium Skirt steaks.  Rookie restaurant mistake ...they brought out our appetizer and our meal at the same time. There was hardly any room on our table. We ate the app fast so our food wouldn't get cold.  The chicharron was beyond excellent.  It was huge and very flavor-able.  I could have eaten two of those and I would have been happy.   The steak ... my sisters was medium and mine was well done.  We both asked for medium. I hate to waste food and I hate well done steak so me in my sister split half and half so we suffered equally. The flavor was good on the steak.  The rice was under cooked and the beans tasted canned.  For that amount of money they are charging this is not acceptable. We got there kinda late 9:30 pm so they started to put the chairs up around us and close the back lights. The restaurant closes at midnight I believe.  That's unacceptable. If the entire restaurant didn't close yet ...don't do that. It's rude.  It only takes minutes to put up the chairs..wait until your customer leave.  I'll be back for the burger and maybe a glass of wine.  Hopefully they work out small kinks.  I wish them luck.

This is subpar Spanish food it's greasy and flavorless. Deff not even good for just drinks as the bartenders don't know much at all. Save yourself some money don't bother coming here. If you ate here and enjoyed it your pallet is that of someone who's lived off fast food your entire life and like the Olive Garden find this amazing .... basura

But drinks are lackluster, I been to most of the restaurants around Mojos and they are the worst in terms of quality of drinks, food they are one of the best, but if you can't get me a decent margarita I won't be back, I can deal with bad food with good drinks but I can't deal with good food with bad drinks."

The décor has a modern aesthetic and the food is very fresh. I've tried just about everything on the menu and I don't think I can complain but you should definitely try the chiccarron buns ( we ordered more than one round of these) and the Latin rice is a must. As for drinks, I tried their frozè ,it's super refreshing and gets the job done ;)"

Took my family for brunch and the food was so delicious. I had Pernil and it was sooo juicy and flavorful. The rice and beans were perfect and the guacamole holy sh_t.

The waitresses/ bartenders wear bras instead of shirts to distract from the fact that the food is overpriced and bland, drinks are mediocre, and the wait times are insane. 40 min wait for a table and then ANOTHER 40 min wait for just appetizers to be brought out is a joke.

Took a while for our server but like I said it was pretty busy so no big deal! Everything was great following the wait from the food down to the presentation. Our server was very helpful with explaining things we were unsure of. We did have one hiccup and didn't receive and cocktail we order. Eventually we got it and the server gave it to us on the house to make up for it, so no harm no foul! Overall great experience and nice place to enjoy a great food and amazing vibe!"

I had the cilantro & beer green rice with chicken. My friend had ceviche and the other had the taquitos appetizer. The only dish that fell short was the taquitos appetizer. My friend thought they were dry and had to ask for a sauce to hydrate them ( which should have come with). The service was ok but could be improved by the servers better knowledge of menu and drinks. Food served at a good paste. The ambiance is great for a night out with friends. More Miami than NY but that's the point. Will be back to try the churros!

There also is no salt and pepper on the table and we couldn't find anyone to get it from without the food getting cold.  I am going to have a drink next time I go and hopefully an appetizer. I really enjoyed my food.  They just need to amp up the service and I would edit this  to five star."

Mohammad one of the managers there was very helpful. Planed a birthday dinner for 19pp. Everyone had a good time and enjoyed the food. Definitely recommend for larger or small groups. Kid friendly as well. We all enjoyed. Thank you Mohammad and the staff for allowing us to have a good birthday dinner. Alex was very accommodating  as well.

The restaurant was very pretty and had nice music and awesome vibes all night long. But the service was slightly slow. When we got seated it took over 20 minutes for the waiter to come to us and introduce himself. We already knew what drinks, appetizers and entrees we wanted to order by this time. The drinks came on time but everything else was very slow. It was busy so we were very understanding but there were multiple times we had to wait over 15 minutes for someone just to refill our glasses with water. After we finished with dessert we sat for another 30 minutes just for someone to get us our check. There was a party of 8 next to us and the waiter seemed very attentive to them and was constantly coming to them with drinks and food in a timely fashion which I found to be very surprising with the current situation I was in. I had plans around the neighborhood early but it has to be canceled because I was literally sitting in the restaurant for over 3 hours because of everything.Besides the slow  service I must say that the food was still very good and I was not disappointed at all with the flavor and amount of food given. Just wish the service was more attentive to their other customers during busy times!"

We got a variety of items from steak to fish, all delicious. They might've gone a little heavy on the salt but still good. Love that menu lights up. No need to use your phone's flashlight to see. The decor and vibe is beautiful. Trendy but still somehow down to earth. Took a point off as the hostess completely ignored me when I walked in and stood by the stand. She went up to the people standing behind me, who came in after me, and seated them first. It was not only rude but strange. But our waitress was lovely. So do not be deterred from going."

I had a chicken salad, and my wife had a catfish po boy.  I had better salads at chains like salad works or chop't.  My wife's po boy was better but it was still pretty average at best.  The food took at about 20-25 minutes and there were no complementary chips or something to eat during the wait.  I think they are still working on their lunch menu but I don't recommend going there for lunch.  The prices were more expensive than other forest hills restaurants.  Unfortunately, Mojo is consistent with FH restaurants where you don't get a lot of value for your buck."

The staff is nice but it takes forever to get your food. The food is mediocre but decently presented. We ordered a cuban sandwich and the pulled pork. The cuban sandwich was delicious while the pulled pork could have used some sort of sauce to liven it up. I will probably not be returning. 3 stars for efforr

Portions are not big but good enough. Brunch won't come with any drinks. No HH for weekends. Mojitos($11 or+1 for flavors)were very light. Probably I won't order again. Tasty food with good service. I love the atmosphere with Latino music. Music are not too loud it's perfect. Not sure how it's like at night but definitely good options for brunch spot.

With that being said, the ambiance was absolutely gorgeous, very chic and modern. We ordered the beef skewers and the chicken taquitos, both were delicious, especially the skewers!

I gave it three stars because most of the food was worth 3.5-4 stars but they gave 2 star service. Not sure if it was because they were understaffed but they seemed to have a decent amount of Bus people to clear the tables and bring water but it took us a little over 45 minutes to get our food. Met up with some family so we tried to patiently wait but after looking around a lot of people next to us we're saying the same thing trying To eye down their waiter to ask them what's going on, as they too we're waiting a long time for their food. The waiters, and servers did not appear to be on the same page because after the 45 minutes the waiter came up to us and asked if we were ready for dessert. When we told him our food hadn't come to his credit he ran to the kitchen to find out what went wrong. He brought up me and my girlfriends order but it seemed he forgot about My cousin and her husbands order (or got distracted with someone/something else in the time it took him to go back to the kitchen a second time) because we waited another ten minutes and we had to flag him down again to ask him where their food was. He ran back again and came back in ten min. When all of the food arrived my girlfriend's Salmon was undercooked but we no longer had the patience to ask them to recook it. The ""Down the Hatch"" ceviche was amazing and I ordered the Pernil which was a little dry but otherwise well presented and tasty. The ambiance of this place is great, the drinks are tasty and it has a lot of potential. I'd be open to trying it again but I really hope the service improves. The previous venue this was ""Exo Cafe"" had similar issues. Good food but service was not that good. Not sure if it's the dynamics of being a two floor venue but I really hope they improve this as I would really like to like this place."

I really liked the decor and the prices are much better than other places in the area. Staff was attentive and the food came out so fast.We got the Wagyu burger and the Cuban and they were both so good! We inhaled the food and think the burger is the best in the area. We would definitely return. There is a .5 because the water tasted weird and had no ice. I also wish they had a non-alcoholic menu as I wasn't feeling mimosas today but wanted something fruity.

The menu was really sad, 3 types of salads, 3 types of sandwiches, main entrees are mixed with brunch menus. So we ordered chips and guacamole. Chips are mixed with banana chips which taste stale and the guac is doused with lemon. We could barely taste the guac. I had steak sandwich and house salad. Again, whoever prepare the food had a heavy hand on lemon. Salad had too much lemon and may have been used as dressing. The steak in the sandwich was so thin and they put so much caramelized onion which made it harder to taste the steak. We had pineapple juice that we had to return because it was watery and full of ice. The virgin mojito was so tarty, too much lemon...again. Service was excellent, music was jamming which made the stay better, hence the 3 stars. Should have went to Cabana."

I was very disappointed. Although the staff was very friendly and helpful the drinks and the food left a lot to be desired.  The Caipirinha that I ordered tasted all sorts of wrong. I ordered the lomo and more mand it was ridiculously salty and kind of cold.

The Jumpin' Lomo I ordered had only 3 tiny pieces of beef. That's no bueno. Learned my lesson here and I won't be coming back. Plenty of Peruvian Restaurants that are not cheap with their portions.

Service was very kind. Food was good. We had Spanish kabobs (diced skirt steak on a stick with three yuca fries)  and chicken mojo. I also ordered a cocktail which was well made. The food was good but nothing amazing. I felt like it was on the level of my home cooking which I love ..but Let's be real.. you don't want to go out for dinner and pay a nice price for food that is on par with what you can make at home. That being said all of the meat was tender/juicy and the dishes had good flavor.

To my knowledge this is the only Latin-fusion restaurant/bar on Austin street. Everyone in Mojo from the owner to the hostess is very polite and friendly. The bartenders know their stuff. Even when my friends and I went on a Friday night the service was impeccable. Camila and Stephanie were behind the bar and they made fantastic drinks despite the large crowd ordering drinks at the bar. They mentioned that their garnishes are fresh and all syrups used for cocktails are made in house. Going based off the taste I'd say it's true. Frozen margaritas and mojitos are great! I ordered the guac and chips, ceviche, and arroz con pollo. At first I did think the food was a little expensive, but the quality was amazing and well worth it. During my meal the manager, Mohammed, approached me to ask how everything was and we ended up conversing for a few minutes. I can't remember the last time a manager/owner approached me on a busy night to make sure my friends and I were enjoying ourselves. Overall I had a great time here. Drinks were perfect, food was delicious, service was impeccable, and the staff were extremely polite. Forest Hills definitely needed a Latin-fusion restaurant and I believe Mojo will be very successful. Highly recommend!!!"

Just now at 11:14am I figure I would return for some mangu and a cold beer since my daughter finally fell asleep. The moment I walked in a gentleman that worked there mumbled something unpleasant, rolled his eyes and pointed to a table in annoyance. Guess I was too early. I felt extremely uncomfortable and unwelcome. I told him never mind and he kept it moving without a care. Me and my Husband live in the Austin area and look forward to brunch every weekend. All it takes is one negative experience to never return somewhere, and at that I was with my child. Back to Jack & Nellies where I can show up a minute early and still receive a warm welcome!"

The place is new and clean inside and will be a solid place for many years the food was good but my coffee was cold and service could have been better . For better eating I would go to my usual mom and pop places but I took my wife and daughter today .

I heard nothing but good things from my friends and tonight we decided to pop in and try it out. The appetizers were great unfortunately I didn't like my fried rice. Which was the least of my problem. Our server Samantha b. was very rude. My friend waited 15 mins to order her second drink because the waitress would walk right past us until we raised our hand. She checked on us once when we got our entrees and I hadn't tried my food yet then when I tried mine and tried to let her know I didn't like it she didn't come back. When I finally got her attention to tell her, everyone was already done with their food and I told her I don't want anything else and with attitude she told me that I should've told her earlier and when I don't like something I should say it as soon as it comes out. I proceeded to tell her I tried to but never got her attention and she just walked away. I work in this industry and I just feel like there could've been a better approach to this situation."

What stood out to me most was the OUTSTANDING service! My waiter Eli informed me of his name, asked if I had any allergies, did I have a favorite food, so attentive to my needs. Shortly thereafter, Matthew, came over to ask if our food met our satisfaction. The ambiance was welcoming. Eli came over to refill our cocktails and suggested something new, adding the perfect compliment to our entrees. The icing on the cake was having our bartender Vanessa check if those drinks were mixed to perfection. What wonderful service at this place. Would suggest for ladies night or a first date. The music keeps you entertained and subtle enough to engage in conversation."

Guacamole, chips, plantains and toasted corn  is a must.  Quinoa salad was so delicious and the fried seafood app is outstanding! As far as the entrees are concerned, the Lomo is a favorite as well as the Mojo Chicken.  But before all that, make sure you get a frozen drink. You won't regret it. I also had a margarita on the rocks and it was delicious. Just the right amount of tequila to mix ratio. A lot of places make it to heavy on the mix. Eli was an outstanding server. Friendly, funny and very attentive. Overall, this is a great place to go and the food will not disappoint."

Because i never actually got the food. I love cuban food. I was SO happy to try this restaurant. I ordered a salad that sounded amazing. I get a text that my salad is going to be 45 min later than anticipated. The 45 min goes by. Still nothing. i call the restaurant. My salad had been sitting there for 30 minutes and the delivery guy never showed up. She asked if i wanted to wait for him and i said no, cancel my order. Why would i want to wait for someone who they don't know is even going to show up or not? And why would they think its okay to send him with a salad that has been sitting out for 30 min? Plus i have to get Seamless to refund me which they haven't yet (this was 2 weeks ago) instead of the restaurant. The thing I'm most upset about is the restaurant did not call me to let me know what was going on waiting 90 min for my delivery and still not getting it. Just the text to say it was going to be late. And i used the first time delivery coupon they offered on food i never received. Nothing but pure aggravation. Thanks Mojo!"

Just finished my dinner here and it was great  I had the pernil and it was to die for. My buddy had the arroz con pollo and it was delicious as well.

I mean I  have never rated  any restaurant before . But I am sorry this place needs to be rated . Terrible meal portion . When we left after spending 1k we ended up going home and ordering domino pizza . Cause we were all starling . So if you like to go to a restaurant to get ripped off, and not get any food , this is the place to go . Menu is super cheap just like their portion in food . Food was terrible . If anyone wants to go eat Spanish food I would not recommend-this place at all ."

In total dinner for two ran us around 120 dollars and left us hungry for more... I understand the place is new but Cabana is right around the corner where the drinks are amazing and the portions are huge for what you are paying... this place has a nicer atmosphere as far and music and the venue itself, I'd say improve on portion size for what you are paying and revamp the drink menu because nothing on it mad it even appealing to try.

Lomo was amazing and so were Chimi sliders. Decor is cute. The churros were kind of stale though and the sangria is not really worth it. It is mostly ice, super sweet, and 3/4 of a pitcher didn't even have me buzzed. In addition, our waitress was not really attentive or friendly at all. Would go back because it is a cool place, just in need of some improvements."

We just departed the restaurant and I am very happy with the service we received. At times I can be difficult to please however, everything was perfect. I tried Garlic Rice for the first time and that alone has guaranteed my return. The food portions are more than enough and the margaritas were delicious. We also tried the Mango Tango dessert which also was delicious. CABANA, move over I have found a new spot"

This place is a joke. It took 10 minutes for a waitress to even ask if we wanted drinks. We were finishing our appetizers by the time our drink came out. Simultaneously with our entrees. I don't know which was worse the service or the food. Bland, overly saucy, stale plantain chips. Chipotle is better. 1 bartender on a Saturday night?!? (On Labor Day weekend). Too bad, it was the only decent thing. Would have ordered another had the service been decent."

We got to the table (3 people), table set for 2 + 1 appetizer plate, waitress brought 1 extra glass no utensils. We finally asked for utensils and napkins. Waitress looked lost and didn't have a clue about the menu. Now food, appetizers we had camaron toast(tasty but cold), wagyu chimi sliders (very good) and Spanish kebabs ( kebab itself good but cold, yuka was soaked in oil, nasty). Main course we had jumpin lomo (SALLLLLLLTTTTTYYYY AND COLD but tasty) salmon ( SALTY but good) macho Marino (SALTY but still tasty). SALLLLLTTTYYY and not warm enough was the consensus (and my sister likes salt and it was salty for her) Can't judge dessert because we never got it since the service sucked. It took 45 min to get main course after we finished eating appetizers, and another 20 for the waitress to show up after we finished the main course and she didn't even offer the dessert menu ! So we said forget the dessert since we were already sitting there for 2.5 hours ( got there 8:45 left 11:30!) and weren't even offered one so we just asked for a check. Now it got me really mad because when I made the reservation I clearly stated that it is a birthday celebration. And to top it all off, I barely check my bill but good thing I did here, we got a 2 pitchers of sangria which on the menu was $30 but we got charged $32, now it's not about the $4 because if I can afford to go to dinner I can pay $4 but about trying to cheat your customers !  I personally would not go back !"

Small portions and I don't like that they didn't change anything about the place. Same set up as the restaurant before. The apps are good but their main courses weren't great.

I seriously love this place. I waited for months for it to open and it did not disappoint. I used to go to the other Cuban spot years ago but it doesnt have the same pop that it used to so I'm happy there's another option. Also, I'm a mojito-phile and their's is well made. It's about $10 for the classics and $11/12 for flavored. They have other drinks but I haven't tried them. My assumption is that they are just as good. There are happy hour deals that bring the cost down to about $7. The food is also good, especially the Chicken Mojo. Price is about $22. A bit much for grilled chicken and rice (double compared to a local Dominican/Cuban spot) but you are paying to dine out in Forest Hills. The vibe is sexy Miami-esqe: Dark wood, dim lighting, modern decor, some palm trees. And the staff is great Stephanie, Matthew, Jordan, Jonathan always are welcoming and accomodating. The implemented a Mo Lunch/Mo Brunch menu a few months ago, which I believe id everyday maybe 12-5p. It's a limited version of their regular menu and cheaper. The brunch items are pretty good and its an overall truly Latin fusion menu (Vegan ceviche, Chicharron Buns) They also have update website and active social media so always check those out for special events"

We started with the kebab and yuca appetizers (heaven on a stick ), followed by the ceviche, chips, and guacamole, all were quite tasty, but my favorite was the kebabs.  I really enjoyed their signature dish, the Mojo chicken that comes with white rice, asparagus, and black beans. I like that the portions are reasonably sized as well. The decor is so beautiful and elegant. Even the restrooms are impressive looking. The service was great, I was very pleased to see a few familiar former Exo Cafe members working there. That is what lured me into the place in the first place. Damian and Tony both made the visit very warm and pleasant. I'm also excited to hear that Mojo will soon offer a weekend brunch special- I'm looking forward to it!!"

Mojo is located in the old Exo Restaurant on Austin Street in Forest Hills. My wife ordered Arroz Con Pollo. The Arroz Con Pollo came with Cilantro Beer Garlic Rice with a butterflied thigh along with a Maduro & a tostones. My wife enjoyed the taste of her entree. I had the entree Macho Marino. The entree included shrimp, squid, bay scallops and yuca fries in a sofrito sauce. White rice accompanied the Macho Marino dish. My dish was very tasty!!! My only complaints were at the beginning and end of my meal. Once we were seated, it took over 5 minutes for a server to come back to our table. After receiving our check from our server, it took another 5+ minutes for the server to return to pick up the bill. Food was good; service was less than stellar."

The first few times I visited Mojo, I was seated in the dining area so I didn't have a view of how my drink was being made. The last time I visited I sat near the bar. The service and food have always been great! BUT there was a hygiene issue with the bartender. Although she was wearing gloves, she used those very same gloves to clean the counter, make drinks (touching the fruits that go into the drinks), fluff her hair repeatedly and handle everyone's money. She did not change or remove those gloves for the entire time that I was there and I was there for at least two hours and who knows how long she'd been wearing those gloves to begin with. None of the staff seemed to notice or correct this issue. Maybe an orientation on cleanliness is in order for the entire Mojo staff. Why bother wearing the gloves in the first place if you're going to use them to touch everything? This is an issue that can be easily resolved, hopefully they do."

When we were leaving we were asked to review the restaurant. So here it goes. My wife and I  wanted to go see what all the hype was about. I can see the potential in this restaurant. But they need a lot of work. The wait was about 20 minutes to get a table. And then another 10 minutes to get the menu, Then another 20 minutes to see the waitress. We had been in the restaurant for at least an hour before we got any type of drinks or food. At least give us some chips while we wait. We ordered a frozen margarita that wasn't frozen at all and very weak in alcohol. We ordered the sliders and pork belly as appetizers. Maybe the waitress forgot about our food because it was cold. So cold the oil started to stick together on the bottom of the plate. The pork belly buns were hard that I got stabbed in the gums. They have a very limited selection on the menu. So you would figure that the food would be excellent.  First off what is it with cold food? both of our dishes were cold  I ordered Jumpin lomo and my wife had the arroz con pollo. I have never tasted food so salty. The jumpin lomo came with rice that wasn't even cooked and the beef was chewy and salty. Arroz con pollo was a joke. Let's be real and say its rice with chicken. That is no arroz con pollo I ever had.  For the price of the food, you would expect a nice portion. My wife was given one piece of chicken thigh on top of a large serving of uncooked rice. The jumpin lomo had lots of rice and fries but very little meat. The service was very mediocre. Why are the girls half naked? It really is a Spanish hooters and the girls behind the bar are not attentive if you are not drooling over them. We wasted about $200 for food and service that was not $200 worth. Like I said before it has potential. The food had flavor but the execution sucked and the service sucked. Once they fix the cold food, food portion, and the service they can excel in forest hills."

Drinks I tend to always go with the White or Red Lychee sangria, both very good. Appetizers a new favorite are the Curry puffs not sure why I didn't try before they are so good, great with the dipping sauce. Good Dumplings, Crab wonton's , Calamari & Wings can't go wrong with either choice.  Main dishes the Spare ribs were delicious great tasting thai style chili sauce the dish comes with veggies, not bad good with the sauce. Basil fried rice has always been a good choice so has the Pad Thai. The Guay Tiew Pad Sei Eiw is a good dish , flat noodles with your choice of meat, great with beef good with chicken as well. Yellow curry chicken is pretty decent , a lot of sauce with this dish best with the white rice. I was very glad these guys were open during Quarantine, we placed an order through yelp & were able to set up a pick up time, once we arrived food was ready , nice & easy process. Service during dinning is good, quick but you don't feel rushed , prices are great here & very reasonable. This place has become a good go to spot for Thai food, I decided to up the stars because so far never been here & had a bad meal, this place is certainly worth the try I will for sure keep stopping by from time to time."

Weve been to some fast food/quick casual type restaurants a few times since there weren't many options in our area so I was happy to see this place was open. L is an essential worker so he gets fed every day at work by Sweetgreen and other catering spots but what we're really missing is some good hot food!! I've always had Kitchen 79 on my list but with all these restaurants available before I never got around to this place. I tried Khao Soi which seemed to be be one of their more popular dishes that not every Thai place has on their menu. For $12 it's actually a good portion. This curry noodle soup comes with soft and crispy noodles,  normally with a chicken leg but here you get it with a generous amount of sliced chicken breast which L loved. There's some pickled veggies which added more texture and tasted pretty good. Everything is packaged nicely so the noodles weren't soggy. I love green curry and normally order it from every Thai place but Kitchen 79 has a slightly different option. I got mine with Thai pasta with a good portion of chicken, bamboo shoots, green beans, peppers. It's $14 but it fed 2 individuals and it was reheated In a pot the next day. It was so good. Not crazy spicy, so we were able to enjoy the curry and all the veggies were still crispy and fresh even though it was sitting in the curry sauce overnight. Great food."

I am amazed!Everything was full of outstanding flavors.There were a few appetizers and a main course and I liked all of them. Rolls stuffed with bean sprouts, cucumbers and egg, topped with a delicious sauce were amazing! Dumplings with chicken and pastries with curry chicken were also expertly prepared. For main course I had brown rice with onion, basil and cucumbers.It won't surprise you if I tell they have  a vast number of vegan options.But this Thai restaurant is good not only for dining, but offers a great variety of the beverage. Beer, cocktails, wine cart, everything is super miscellaneous. There is something for your liking among the diversity of non-alcoholic spirits as well. Me personally was surprised with their huge portion of good iced coffee. The interior is stylish and the service hasn't disappointed.Will definitely explore the rest of the menu"

How have I not tried this place. Now I onlyOrdered one dish but the flavors, the presentation and the prompt service. I ordered the Gang Phed Phed Yaang the duck was crispy but so juicy and the curry sauce is delicious - aromatic and the perfect type of spicy. The veggies were crisp and steamed and their brown rice (notPictured here) was perfectly cooked. I will definitely be ordering again !"

Really great bar food as well. Service is wonderful and attentive even when the place is packed. The chicken pot pie wasn't great, more of a soup based on that dish, but the chicken sliders were amazing as were the nachos. Great vegetarian and vegan options. I had the plant based ""meatloaf"" with sprouts and potatoes. The sauce on the meatloaf was delicious. Savory with a slight kick. They always have a great rotating selection of good beers.Had a great time coming here with a couple of friends - vibe is laid-back with a lot of great drink options available. We did not have food, but have heard good things and would definitely into dining her in the future. Good for bigger groups as well.All in all a nice place to sit down with friends for good food and good drinks. One of the best things about the place, in my opinion is the fact that the music there is not too loud as to prevent conversationExcellent beer selection, fantastic space, and great happy hour specials, if a bit too noisy during peak times."

Standing at 4.5 stars with over 580 reviews, Kitchen 79 deserved my attention. Kitchen 79 does have the small, cozy restaurant feel to it. I prefer the full ethnic decorative style, so I must say I was a little underwhelmed by the interior design choices. The food and presentation, however knocked it out the park. Starters included the fried calamari, in addition the Ya Ma Mong, which is basically the mango salad with shrimp. For the main course, I ended up with the monster sized Pla nung manow (steamed fish with spicy lime sauce) with a side of sticky rice and she the curry chicken with white rice. We couldn't be happier with the dinner choices, as everything was fantastic. I must critique the service, the waiter was a little lento considering it is such a small place. For those in the Jackson Heights area, you have a neighborhood gem that impresses with great tasting food and presentation schematics. The service, at least for my experience, was not on par with the likes of Kin'd in Fresh Meadows, nevertheless the reviews are justified."

I hate it when I am looking forward to a great time and totally excited for a place but they literally ruin my experience!!! After reading fellow yelper reviews, I had high expectations for this place. Probably my bad luck also I'm a highly picky eater. I love the decor very elegant and romantic. The whole plan was to have dinner and a surprise my friend at the end with a birthday wishes from the restaurant crew. We were seated immediately by the manager as the place wasn't busy at all. We ordered fried chicken dumplings and veggie dumplings for appetizer. For entree we chose: Pad Thai with tofu and sautéed chicken with string beans. My friend liked his fried chicken dumplings and for the price paid the quantity was good as well. I was highly disappointed for the veggie dumplings as they looked nothing like what I expected so I had to return it back to the kitchen. Therefore no appetizer for me sadly!! Pad Thai was ok nothing exceptional as I had better and portion size can be improved. Sautéed Chicken w/ string beans and side of rice was absolutely ridiculous in regards to taste and quantity!! We have asked for medium spicy and even inquired with the host how spicy is it. But my friend was barely able to eat it as it was really spicy and requested it to be re-made. Now this is where the complete bs starts....the host comes back with little bit of chicken, asked us to taste it. We did and it was fine in regards to the spice level. The host takes the plate back again and comes back with little bit of chicken and more than half the plate full of string beans!!! I even asked the host is this it?? He's like yes this is your food. This is all you get!! Utter bs, so you are charging me for less than half the food that was on the plate the first time? One of the major issues was lack of communication as our host wasn't very fluent in English. I am not even sure if he understood what I have said when I placed the order. The manager was aware of the situation but she didn't come attend my table until I requested for her!! That's what you call poor customer service. If you are aware of what is happening then attend your customer and resolve it. She knew there's communication conflict between the host and me. Not a place for me!!"

Everything was cooked just right.Everything was simply delicious- nothing was left behind!The service was great.

Upon looking at Kitchen 79, I was excited to eat there because of its quiet and quaint appearance, just off the main road. There weren't many other people eating there, so my friend and I had  our choice of seating. Their menu is very extensive, so you will definitely find something that suits your appetite. The service was very quick and everything we ordered was delicious. Plus, they serve huge portions, so come hungry! They have good Thai iced tea, and plenty of vegetarian options, or dishes they can easily make with your choice of meat or tofu.

I arrived around 7:30 at night on Christmas Eve and there was no wait for a table. We were sat down right away and we noticed how clean and well decorated the restaurant is. There aren't a lot of tables but the other people that came after us did not have to wait. We order beef satay and thought the beef was on the chewier end. The satay sauce was not what we expected (we've been to a number of Thai places in different regions before). The app was all right but I wouldn't order it again.  While we were waiting for our entrees, the waitress took away our silverware despite not being done eating the appetizer. I'm guessing this was in preparation for the entree but we were dipping the satay beef into the sauce while they were doing this, so I found this rather weird. We ordered a plate of pad see ew with pork and a bowl of Khao soi, replacing the chicken for fried tofu. The pad see ew tasted good, saltier than we are used to and less sweet tasting. The khao soi was delicious and a reasonable level of spice. While the bowl didn't look like much, there were a lot of noodles and add-ins inside. I was pleasantly surprised by the pickled veggies inside. I ended up not being able to finish and had to get it packed to go (still tasted great the next day!). It wasn't a super long wait after but no one checked in with us after we got our dishes or after we were done eating. I had a bit of trouble flagging someone down to get the check, but after I did the process was smooth and they said bye and thanks to us on our way out."

My go to entree is either Massaman curry which consists of Indian inspired spices blended in chili paste with onion, potato, peanuts simmered in coconut milk or Guay Tiew Pad Kee Mau which is wok fried spicy flat noddles with egg, basil leaves & bell peppers.

This time around I tried the som tum, pad Thai, red curry and basil eggplant stir fry. I think that the basil eggplant stir fry was the best dish we had on the table and it was the only one we finished. The rest was just average to subpar tasting Thai food that you can get anywhere else in the city. If it wasn't for the proximity of this restaurant to Elmhurst's mini Thai town I suppose that might be ok but I was disappointed and regretted not going to one of my favorite haunts there instead. My recommendation is skip this place and head to Elmhurst Av and eat over there instead."

The decor is cute and the staff is friendly. The food really brings it home though. Everything is prepared very well. We started off with the papaya salad which is one of my favorites and what I judge Thai food on. Well, this may be the best papaya salad I've ever had! The flavor was great and not too fishy. I also had the wild boar curry which also had great flavor. Why they didn't get 5-stars: This needs a 4.5-star rating because they're near perfect. I ordered the wild boar dish because I wanted something a little different. The sauce was great but it overshadowed the boar a bit and the eggplant was a bit undercooked for my taste."

I tried:Tod mun goong (deep fried shrimp cakes): I prefer the non deep fried versions. There wasn't any Thai spices in this at all (usually for these cakes you get kaffir lime, red curry flavor...) so it was really just deep fried shrimp paste. Gauy tiew pad kee mau with crispy pork: this came out a bit cool (sitting in the kitchen a while?) and it was a mistake to order crispy pork because it tasted hard/stale and quite unpleasantMoo yang (grilled marinated pork with sticky rice): really nothing special and a tad too sweet. Kanom jeen numya phoo (crab curry with Thai pasta): this was the only good dish. We asked for spicy but it was not very spicy at all (lots of coconut milk). There were a lot of nice crab chunks and went well with the bean sprouts, Thai ""pasta"", basil, and pickled greens. Overall, there are much better Thai choices in the area. This one is just ok at most."

Fantastic delivery service too!!! :)They give a much more diverse range of appetisers when you order their lunch specials, I'm talking about those crab cheese dumplings and curry puffs. The lunch specials in question, starting from only $7.95! I had put in an order of Pad See Eiw (chicken) with curry puff as the appetiser and basil fried rice with salad as the appetiser.The pad see eiw had a great texture to the noodles and there was ample amounts of chicken breast in there, however when it came to the sauce, it was lacking something and needed that extra umph. The curry puff that came with it was probably one of the best (if not THE best) I've had in my life, the pastry was so deliciously flaky and buttery while the filling was packed with curry wonder....the soft potato pieces combined with the buttery taste of the pastry? Omg they just put my inside the curry puff, it would be a happy death :D they also included a sweet, slightly tangy cucumber dipping sauce which I basically drank in one shot haha xDThe basil fried rice (with shrimp, only an extra $1) was better, the shrimp tasted super juicy and fresh, generous amounts of basil, good ratio of vegetables in there too. The spiciness wouldn't have you frantically grabbing for water but enough to let you know it's there. Overall the flavours were well balanced. The salad that came with it, was just your standard salad that you'd get at your average Thai restaurant but they packaged really prettily....kinda almost makes you not want to eat it so you don't ruin it haha :)The portions are on the smaller side but still worth every penny!!! I definitely look forward to dining there, from pictures I've seen from other diners, quite fanciful for a Thai restaurant and definitely for one in Jackson Heights. I don't know why it took me this long to discover it.....Go for a visit, you'll love it too ^^"

Noticing the food is changing. The Pad Thai is now overly sweet and more chewy. I had a whole fish here as well with a mango salad and I don't recall anything remarkable besides the fish's head. I am sad because this was my favorite Thai place in the area. P.S. They must be cleaning their dishes/utensils with bleach, but the smell for me on the cups is too much."

Nice flavors!  We got vegetable dumplings- great flavor and texture! Super flavorful noodles - Pad Woon Sen, but we found the pork to be too chewy (next time try vegetable). The veg curry was good but not really memorable flavor-wise. Although we wanted mango (didn't have) sticky rice, we enjoyed coconut ice cream with sticky rice (with exception for whipped cream which tasted commercial). Service was great, but sadly we were served a plate with a giant chip on it - not acceptable! Also, parking is pretty tough around it."

I ordered a Thai iced tea and it was huge!!!! Literally the most I've ever got in a Thai restaurant ever!! I had the curry puff as my appetizer and a tofu pad Thai. The pad Thai was good, but it wasnt out of the world. It is worth it for your money though because they do give a lot. The curry puff was good, but I thought it wasn't as crunchy and crispy as I normally had. The servers were attentive. Parking wise- it's a bit easier if you go during the week around lunch.

The coconut soups are delicious as well as the entrees. This time around, we ordered the crispy duck and steamed fish. The fish takes longer to make but it's worth waiting for. The food can get a bit spicy but the cooks can make it milder or even less spicy. Definitely check this place out in Jackson Heights."

Ordered beef pad see eiw as my entree and deep fried tofu as my app. The service was very friendly and accommodative. The tofu was crispy and fresh. The only reason why I took off a star was because my pad see eiw was DOUSED in sauce, which made it super salty - snug my lip a bit from the saltiness because I had a small cut. (You can kind of see the amount of sauce in the picture)I've had the same dish at multiple other Thai places, so I was a bit taken back by the sauce to noodle ratio- had to even check yelp, but maybe it was just this one time the chef prepared my dish. Beef was also over cooked so it felt like I was gnawing on rubber.Ambiance is a bit tooooo dark, considering it was also a very gloomy day out alreadyLychee juice was yummy and refreshing.Will be returning"

The appeal of the restaurant looks like something you would find in Manhattan rather than Jackson Heights. When I first walked in, there were not many people in the restaurant. There was a large party of around 12 and a few other small groups. I decided to get a table. The decor is absolutely stunning. The floor tile pattern was also very appealing. It's a perfect place if you want to get together with your friends after not seeing them for some time or if you are going on a date since the volume of the atmosphere is somewhat quiet. I ordered the lunch special. This comes with an appetizer and an entree for the price of 7.95/8.95 (depending on the meat). I got the Shrimp Guay Tiew Pad Sei Eiw which is by far my favorite thing to get at Thai restaurants. It was a little saltier than most Thai places. There was probably more soy sauce than anything. It was your typical pad see ew. The appetizer was geoy nam which was chicken broth soup with minced chicken wonton. You get two wontons in this small bowl of chicken broth. I must say, the chicken wonton was very fresh, almost homemade which reminded me so much of my grandmother's home cooking. It is not your typical Chinese takeout kind of wonton soup. It was clear and fresh. LOVED the appetizer. The waiters here are very attentive and very quick. They are also very accommodating. The service was excellent. I would definitely come back for the fried calamari and curry."

It has some 'Michelin star' items so that's very promising although I didn't go for those dishes. I tried generic shrimp drunken noodles and my friend went for the glass noodle salad. These are basic dishes so I can't really say much about them. They taste as they should. The place was very quiet and not crowded for a weekday evening, which was good.

It's a dine in perk only.So the curry puff was decent. It wasn't crunchy anymore but that's okay.The pad see ew with chicken was okay too. The star of the dish was honestly the flavor of the noodles. The chicken was on the dry side and the vegetables didn't taste that great. It was a good price for the portion size though.

The food here is delicious! They have so many authentic dishes that it was hard to figure out what to try but everything my party did get was super tasty. I would definitely recommend the steamed whole fish (very fresh and loved the herbs and sauce on it) and the pad thai (the best I have ever had). The gaeng tai pla curry was, no joke, every spicy. Our waiter had warned us so it definitely is not for everyone. It also has a fishier taste to it due to the mackerel. The icing on the cake is their cheap drinks! $5 for a lychee mimosa or sangira (white and red). They also currently have $3 beers all day long. I believe it usually is just one beer on draft. The area is inconvenient to get to by car because of the parking and congestion but I will be back for sure!"

So delicious, I kept ordering even when I found legit reasons not to. For example, that looong hair piece i found on my singapore noodles back in April. Or, how about that plastic piece I found in my lunch todaY? Or how about the countless inconvenient times we ""returned"" the delivered food upon their ""request"" as proof there was really an issue? Sounds like ya'll have some trust issues...  Upon calling the restaurant back just to inform them, I received nothing short of an attitude. I didnt understand why I was getting this type of tension until the owner called me personally. Apparently, the person that dealt with my order, Pearl, was their last day.  Im pretty sure I can understand with one foot out the door, that person didn't want to bother understanding ""damage control"" for the next job that person receives. The back of house, probably feels some type of way because not only do I pride myself of being super honest, they can't admit their own possible mistakes. Even when I sent them pictures! What egos! The first step anyone can tell you is be accountable for your mistakes because mistakes happens! No big deal in my eyes, as long as you acknowledge a mistake was made. .  I wore many hats in restaurants and been in the business for 15+ years. Something I didn't believe I would grow to love the food industry, but I do. However, upon learning of the possible ""cost overhead"" the owner explain she would lose ($30 lunch), I decided to bide my final farewell. I'm too old to be petty and come up on a free meal. You were going to end up giving me the refund to end up throwing away the returned food, so what exactly are you losing? It doesn't make sense for you to ""explain"" food cost to me if logically youre not going to do anything with the contaminated food. Or are you? She even recommended I dont order anymore as she was ""embarrassed"" by the restaurant's behavior.  Apparently, she owns 5 - 2 in manhattan, 1 in queens, and quite frankly, the one in queens is the only one with ""such problems"". While we were understanding enough to accomodate the restaurant, after numerous mishaps, it appears that they need the money more than they needed a honest loyal customer. To the owner: sorry for your troubles, better fix the house before it burns down. To the public: Hope this doesn't happen to you, eat at your own risk."

First off it was a little dry and not very flavorful. Second the portion was appetizer sized. My friend ordered the pad Thai and it was delicious! Each noodle was covered in flavor without being salty or too ""wet"". Also the pad Thai portion is about 3 times larger then any other noodle dish. The fried calamari is also fried very well and with the mayo sauce it was gone within 10 seconds. I can see myself coming back again and again but for the pad Thai."

They've done just enough to separate themselves from the Woodside competition, all while becoming part of the awesome dining scene in Jackson Heights.In some ways, they're sort of like the Blend restaurants of Astoria / LIC but the Thai version. Food wise, everything is beautifully plated and the trendy undertones are perfect for the average Instagrammer / food pornographer. Thankfully, most everything tastes as good as it looks.Some of the standouts include their yum wonsen (glass noodle salad), their dark colored pad sei ew, ten ta fu (spicy red curry soup), ka nom jeen gang tai pla (shrimp curry with rice noodles), and their jumbo white crab fried rice. I would feel comfortable recommending the entire menu honestly, especially their massive Thai iced teas. Good Thai fare doesn't come cheap unfortunately, at least not at K79. Most entrees are a good $3+ compared to most Thai establishments in the area. The portions are debatable as well, while not being too small but certainly not entirely abundant either. This alone might be a turn off for some folks, but the primary focus is flavor and not portion.Service is spot on. I've never had an issue with the staff or even the speed of my food (notable issues with even the best Thai restaurants) but I think the best approach is to order a number of dishes for sharing to get a true taste of what they do best. It can get tricky though with their tight interior, group dining is not as easy as the date setup that they've got."

The selection of appetizers is varied as well and includes items such as curry puffs, spring rolls, roti, soup or salad. The entree selection as well has something for everyone with noodles, curries, and rice dishes all offered.We opted for the pad thai and pad priew wan. The pad thai noodles were not too sweet or spicy - just the right amount of flavor. The waitstaff here was very friendly and will offer to have the dishes made to cater to your tastes. The pad priew wan is not a dish you often find in Thai places. It is a rice dish with meat sauteed with pineapple, tomato, and sweet and sour sauce. I found the flavor of it to be very rich and interesting.This place in general had many dishes you will not find in other (more Americanized) Thai places. These include dishes like yum woon sen (glass noodle salad), khao soi (northern Thai soup) and jungle curry. Definitely give this place a try."

The curry puffs were stuffed with mushy curried potatoes. They were nice and came four in an order. The Tom yum was filled with vegetables like mushrooms, onions and carrots. The broth tasted very lemony, a bit too much lemongrass but was not salty. That was a big plus. The chicken broad noodle dish was good. The noodles were thick and tasty. The dish came in a simple brown sauce that didn't smother the noodles and the vegetables were bright and crunchy. Still some flavor to make the dish complete was missing.Mera's Tip: try the curry puffs."

It took me longer than it should have to figure out why the straw wouldn't go through. The thai iced tea is delicious; flavorful and not too sweet, but half of the drink consisted of ice. We had the pad thai, pad see ew, drunken noodles (pad kee mao), gaeng kiew warn (green curry), curry puffs, and pla muk tord (calamari). The noodles  were good, but not the best I've had. Curry puffs were also very good and comes with some sort of sweet sauce, although I've had better. I highly recommend the green curry, which was delicious and mildly spicy, and the calamari. The calamari was nice and crispy and comes with a sauce that tastes like thousand islands dressing."

The servers need to be more in tuned with the customers, but that's about it. We ordered two appetizers, the Tao Hoo Tord - which is the deep fried tofu served with sweet chili sauce and peanuts and the Saty Gai - thai marinated chicken satay served with peanut sauce. Both were really scrumptious. For entrees we ordered - the Khaophad which has thai fried rice with Chinese Broccoli, tomatoes, onions, and scallion (your choice of meat, chose chicken). Another entree chosen was Ka Nom Jeen Gang Kiew Warn Gai which is Thai pasta with chicken, basil leaves, eggplant, and coconut milk in green curry. Very delicious both of the entrees, however we needed to add some condiments to the dishes for more flavoring. Last but not least, we ordered fried coconut ice cream as the other tables got it and it looked great. They put it on fire and it just burns the fried part of the ice cream. The coconut part wasn't overly powering which was great. I did order a red sangria as a drink since it's only $5."

The vegetables were crisp and not soggy. The spice wasn't overwhelming. And my favorite: it wasn't greasy. They didn't use crazy amounts of oil to sauté everything. Delicious food. Large portions.

Interior is very modern though all of the glassware and close proximity to other tables have prevented us from bringing our young kids here. Service is always top notch here as they wait staff is has always been attentive to our needs. Here are some of our thoughtsPros:- reasonably priced and the food is consistently cooked well. #1 reason why we keep coming back with take out orders- very quick turnaround time from the time of our order to food at our table/at our door- nice mix of modern and traditional dishes- lots of healthier options/alternatives- clean bathroomCons:- don't bother leaving comments on online orders. For example, we've repeatedly requested that our order not include plastic utensils, plastic straws and white rice which is ignored (trying to reduce waste)- there were few times that our food was either over cooked, overly oily, or ended up being smaller than normal. However this is not the norm.- restaurant can be tight"

This  duck noodle soup save me from the cold. Love the spice and sweetness from duck leg. You can taste the freshness and feel like mommy home cooking. Look for nowhere for real quality Thai food.

I went here during lunch hour with my cousin and we both ordered their version of pad se ew for entree,  and we both also shared the dish since we know we weren't going to finish our food if we got separate dishes. For appetizers, we ordered crab wontons however it's called a different name on the menu, I am not able to recall the exact name. The crab wontons are worth every penny, they are absolutely delicious and crunchy. During lunch special they only give you two wontons, so me and my cousin decided to order another set of crab wontons and I believe they give you 6 crab wontons in total. We also ordered two Thai ice teas and boy was the glass huge, this is the first Thai place that gives you a huge glass bombarded with lots of Thai ice to drink. I believe this place is worth it however I didn't like the attitude of one of the waiter and that's why I couldn't give it a 5 star. I just believe they need more attentive staff."

I went out with family and friends so it was 5 of us. Gratuity is applied on parties of 5 or more. So it seemed like, since her gratuity was already included in the bill, she didn't have to be courteous, happy or attentive. Service is everything. A restaurant can have mediocre food and awesome service and I would go over and over again. You feel welcome and you are happy to spend your money because you are treated well. But a place that has delicious food and poor service will not get my hard earned dollars ever."

If I'm ever craving Thai food, this is my go to spot! I'm really fond of their lunch special because it's not expensive and it comes with appetizers as well (geoy hor cheese is soo good). Their service is always good and they are very kind too! If you come during the day, it won't be that crowded, however during the night they get very crowded.

The interior is modern and cozy. In terms of the food nothing really stood out to me. One of the chicken dish we ordered came out barely cooked and it seemed like they just microwaved it...

I heard about this place and made the trek out to queens from Manhattan to try it. Started with a lychee mimosa - I think it was only $5 and very tasty. Had the Tom kha gai soup which was excellent. Then had the ka nom jeen gang tai plan - a noodle dish with pumpkin, eggplant, vegetables, shrimp and mackerel in a spicy sauce. The waitress at first tried to dissuade me from ordering this as she insisted the sauce was very spicy and the mackerel had an overpowering flavor. I tried it anyway and it was quite good, but she was right - only order this if you love spicy food and don't mind the mackerel flavor. We also had the ka prow ka moo which I highly recommend. The pork was soft and juicy and the flavor was excellent. I would definitely return here to try more from their extensive menu."

The service, food and ambiance we're all excellent.  Mixed menu with several signature drink options for purchase.  Our group had the sangria, fish, Thai rice, dumplings, calamari, beef dish, soup, Papaya salad and dessert.  Everything was delicious!

Come in to try their dishes with a high expectation since I am very getting bored about Ayada Thai food restaurant around the area. Want to try something new. What a mistake that I made for the day. Because I got the food poisoning with their food. I order their pad cha fish. I am wondering how long they have stock their fish in their refrigerator. Because when it come to the table, basically I can feel like this fish is coming from the frozen pack and tasteless.  After leaving the restaurant within an hour, I got a very bad stomachache and have very bad diarrhea and fever .Technically, I just eating with a bunch of deep fired frozen fish from the out of expiration date package. A big warn for dine in. Avoid this dish. Please see my pic. Good luck"

We arrived on a  Saturday afternoon at around 3pm and was told we can sit anywhere we pleased. There was not much people there so its the perfect place to sit and talk and catch up with a friend.  I was on a no carbs thing so I was not able to order what I really wanted to eat so I settled for a salad even though the menu is an extensive one filled with many options. As an appetizer I ordered the chicken satay and for an entree I had a salad. The salad was made with seasoned ground chicken, red onions, scallions, mint leaves and roasted rice on a bed of lettuce. At first the salad was good but then it became too much. Way too much ground chicken and it was way over seasoned. The mint leaves was also too much. I don't think I got through half of it. The chicken satay on the other hand was very very delicious definitely wish I had more of that dish. For my drink I ordered a red lychee sangria and I was not really a fan, too sweet and too strong for me. As for my friend I think she enjoyed everything she had which was coconut soup and also a mango salad. So I would definitely wanna return and try other options on their menu because I think I may actually enjoy the food."

Could hardly see what I was eating. The table I sat at was oddly large for 2 ppl. My sister couldn't hear me from the other side. Food:If a Thai place should get 1 think right, it should be the pad thai. It was sweet and had a fishy smell like the fish they use in Vietnamese food. So that was a turn off, I've had good pad thai before, this was not even close. The pad see ew was also overly sweet with the fish well. My sister got green curry noodles which was watered down, so the flavor was almost non existent. The noodles were extra skinny so there's not much chewing happening. We finished with lychee cream brûlée, which wasn't too bad, the best thing we had there. The lychee fruit is at the bottom of the dish and the cream is sitting on top of it. Overall, I was disappointed with the food. I felt I wasted my night and money on this place. Wouldn't go again."

Its very obvious the rice is old because of the dry hard texture and brown color on some spots of the rice. I get most restaurants serve old rice but try to make it less obvious jeez.

I've been coming to Kitchen 79 since moving here about two years ago. It's a regular staple for me and my wife. The quality of food, happy hour choices, and variety of the menu is unique and a great value for the price. If you're into keto-friendly dishes, order one of their sautéed dishes with meat and vegetables and don't eat the side of rice it comes with. They also have the best raw shrimp salad, but ask them to make it mild because otherwise it can become exceedingly spicy. We usually have Tom as a server, who's very helpful in recommending dishes or steering you clear of dishes that may be too spicy."

They have a bar stocked with beer and wine. The lychee mimosa was very good and it tasted like lychee soda. I would highly recommend trying it. My friends and I started off with the curry puffs and calamari. Usually I don't expect much with calamari when I visit other restaurants, but the calamari and sauce were so appetizing and delicious! The curry puffs were soft, flaky, and had so much filling. We ordered the guay tiew pad sei eiw, gauy tiew pad kee mau, and the guay tiew rad nha. Each one was flavorful, savory, and scrumptious. My friends and I have all traveled to Thailand before so there has always been an impending feeling of disappointment when we tried other Thai restaurants in new york. However, the pad sei eiw at Kitchen 79 is spot on, delicious, delectable, and close to authentic. The noodles were cooked perfectly, the chicken was moist, and the broccoli was sauteed well. In conclusion, the service was great, waiters were very friendly, and the food was amazing. I would definitely love to revisit this establishment and try other items on the menu."

It had a cozy feel to it that was topped off with great service. My choice of meal was the crispy duck salad and my sister had the pad thai - both options were amazing. It was my first time having duck and I was a bit nervous to try it, but I can confidently say that I will definitely be going back for a larger portion of it! The pad thai wasn't super oily like other thai spots, it had a perfect balance of flavors. Definitely try the lychee sangria, the sweetness of it was one of a kind!"

You've been warned! Also, I believe the 7 train runs here so that's an option. The store front doesn't have a sign above, only a circle inside the window that says ""79"" so it may be hard to find for some and it's also located within the block and not on the main Ave. This restaurant is absolutely gorgeous, the pictures do make it seem bigger than it is. The minor details are simply exquisite and there's no doubt that a lot of time and money was spend on the decor. The seats are leather, the chandeliers are stunning and the overall layout of the restaurant is great! They made such good use of the limited space they do have.  The bathroom is so cute. The waiters have denim aprons and the dishes are served in either square or oval shaped plates. The water is served in beer glasses and there is a full bar (with a check in offer). Upon arrival, (7:30pm-Saturday), my bff and I were greeted right away and seated. We opted for the love seat which I absolutely adored. A very unusual seating area which would be perfect for a couple/date night. The staff was very helpful with the questions I asked, kudOs. What we got for under $50: the menu has so many options, it was hard to choose a dish! Curry Puffs: delishDumplings: moist, savory, mMmmMmMy friend got some worth of pineapple and chicken dish with white rice from the ""wok"" section. It was perfectly sweet and yummy!I got the 1st option of fried rice (I forgot the name but it's the first one in that section). I opted for medium spicy and got it with shrimp. This was really flavorful. I felt as though the rice was a bit grainy and the portion was unusually small. Teatree Fried Ice cream: they do serve this with flames. Eh, it tasted smoky and burnt. I didn't like the taste of the outter shell but the ice cream itself was good. Thai Ice Tea - large portion and very good. Overall: beautiful ambiance and good food."

We dine at Kitchen 79 at least twice a month and also order takeout from here occasionally. The food is delicious, service is fast, and the decor is beautiful.

Hence why I eat a lot of Thai food lol. It's on the corner of 79st and Roosevelt ave. It's a small space but cozy and intimate feeling. The decor is modern,sexy with black and white accents and dim lighting to set the mood. I've sat everywhere in the restaurant and this last time I sat at the bar. And had a glass of white wine while I waited for my gf to arrive. My only problem is that the bar only has wine and beer. They need to step that up cause I was really craving a lychee martini and instead had to settle for wine. I went to the bathroom to wash my hands and it's small but clean and smells good. Once I was out of the bathroom my gf had arrived. We browsed thru the menu and we decided to share chicken Satay. It's one of my favorite Thai apps. The grilled chicken flavor,delicious peanut sauce and the refreshing cucumber sauce is just a perfect combo. I can eat this daily lol. For dinner she had what looked like a beef stir fry with veggies,ginger and brown rice. I tried it and it was delicious, but it wasn't spicy and I love my Thai food spicy. I went for the red coconut curry with shrimp,bell peppers,bamboo shoots,basil and jasmine rice. I really enjoy this dish. Silky sauce,complex flavors,perfectly cooked shrimp,veggies and a pretty decent amount of heat but not overwhelming. The jasmine rice is the perfect compliment to it. Just a great balance overall. Just thinking about it is making my mouth water lol. I alternate between this spot and arunee Thai which is down the block from my apt. I do however like the more intimate vibe of this place. The prices are right,good food and service will keep me coming back."

The salty crab didn't really add much to the experience and I could have gone without it, perhaps I did not eat the crab the right way. - the Larb Gai Larb Moo Salad; pretty good and flavorful, similar to the other nearby Thai restaurants. -Peek Gai Mak Khamin Tord (chicken wings); they had flavor combination of salty, savory and some slight sweetness.

The chicken pad thai was excellent and came in a good amount; I couldn't even finish it! The thai iced tea was, to put it simply, beautiful. It wasn't too sweet and had a great taste.The staff were really friendly. Our waiter kept checking on us and refilled our waters. Everything was served fairly quickly. Four lunch specials with four thai iced teas and an extra appetizer came out to be around $50."

It is my favorite dish and having had some of the best ones in Thailand, I know when a good dish is GOOD! And this is probably one of the best! It was less oily than the ones I had before, and thats a pro. Very flavorful and had tons of beef (although my friend ordered the same and didnt have much beef). I guess I lucked out and stole his. :) Be warned that the dish is on the sweeter side. I actually prefer it this way, but this could rub people the wrong way. Cost: $7.95 lunch special and came with the spring rolls (small and not worth any mentions).I also ordered the Thai Ice Coffee which was also on the sweeter side with a bit too much ice. It was served in a large mug, and priced at $3.50. Reasonable but on the pricier side for the neighborhood.What I really like about this restaurant is the decor. I really like it. It is chic and modern, clean in a warm/dark setting. It does not feel like you are at a Thai Restaurant and a great place for a date if you are in the area. We sat in one of the two booths by the window. Prices are very reasonable and dishes are great. One last mention is that the lunch portions are not huge but would be filling if you add an appetizer to the meal."

Gets pretty busy on weekend evening hours. Should've called ahead for reservations because ended up waiting about 30 mins for table for 6. Had space at bar though. Nice touch with free beer with entree with yelp check in. Ordered beef Kee mao (drunken noodles). I've had better. It was a bit dry and couldn't been more spicy and larger portioned. Others in party who ordered same dish were still hungry after even with sharing 3 appetizers. Others in party who ordered pad Thai were very happy and dish portion seemed larger. Would return to try other dishes.

Everything was delicious, the Larb salad was on par with other Larb salad I have gotten at Thai restaurants on    Woodside ave a few blocks away. The Thai ice tea and Thai coffee comes in big beer mugs. Keep in mind, when they ask how spicy you want your dish, spicy is very very spicy!"

We usually order in so we never had an issue with the actual dining experience. Today we were highly disappointed as we ordered our favorite dish on the menu ""Pad see Ew"" and it tasted flavorless and burnt. I sent it back and decided to try the other plate we ordered which was the pineapple fried rice, looking for some satisfaction after the terrible pad see ew. I am enjoying the rice until one mouthful tasted awfully weird. I was chewing on napkin. There was a piece of napkin in my food !!! And it was cooked into the rice so I couldn't tell the difference until i chewed it. So unpleasant. The worse part is that they didn't seem sorry at all. They didnt even offer us anything off the bill or gave us anything complementary. We had to request them to take the plate off the bill. We will not be eating here again, i suggest you dont either."

The appetizers we're a bit different style of what I usually see but the taste was pretty good. The sauces they used on the appetizer and entrees matched the dish really well. Their crispy duck llred curry dish was really good. The duck was cook to it's perfection and not dry at all. Their chicken pad thai noodles were great as well. Their Thai green milk tea was super size and tasted just right! Didn't expect it to be in a huge cup - definitely shareable size. I also had their mango sticky rice which also tasted pretty good and the mango was not just a few pieces but a while mango! Atmosphere was nice too - they have candlelights so it's a good date spot too. Service was definitely attentive and the food came out at a nice pace.

But my friends and I were craving Thai food and came across this Kitchen 79. Cute little restaurant tucked away in the corner of 79th street and Broadway!  Though we were disappointed to find that there was no lunch special or drinks offer because it was a holiday (President's day), we were still delighted by the quality of our meals. I always resort to pad see ew because it's one of my favorites but this time my husband got it and I ordered pad woon sen, which is made with glass noodles, eggs, ear mushrooms, chives, and I got it with chicken. I really enjoyed my dish. It wasn't spicy but it had a pepper kick to it. The vermicelli wasn't dried and I devoured the dish in minutes!  Hubby liked the pad see ew- surprisingly some Thai places can't make a good one as it can easily be too salty but this one was sweet and a good balance of meat to noodles. We also got the Thai iced coffee which came in a huge hug/cup and was delicious. My personal favorite that ended our meal was the lychee creme brulee. Wow! If I can make a dessert like that I'd want to open up my own shop too. It has the perfect texture and taste of a great creme brulee but with surprising chunks of lychee that add a surprisingly element to this popular dessert. I would get it again next time!"

Three years on, this place has gone downhill.... FAST. The only thing going for it is the team of delivery guys who are fast and always friendly.The food has gone from 5 stars to no stars. Before, noodle dishes were tasty and packed with fresh ingredients. Now the ENTIRE bowl is CLUMPED together (see my pic from today). They included plastic forks/knives/spoons with my order but how do I use a plastic fork on a CLUMP of noodles that's as hard as cement?Last week I thought the restaurant was just having a bad night. I ordered Pineapple rice for myself and a curry for my husband.The ""pineapple"" rice? Don't EVEN call it pineapple rice when you can't be assed to put in more than 3 minute chunks of pineapple. And don't call this dish rice when the ENTIRE bowl was a CLUMP of overcooked, tasteless gooey garbage. It was revolting. I ate half because I hadn't eaten all day. My husband took one bite of his curry and put it in the fridge to save for the dog.What the hell? When did good, authentic Thai food become tasteless, don't-give-a-hoot-about-our-customers crap? WHAT A DISAPPOINTMENT. Put some effort into your meals, Kitchen 79 or you will close in no time.I pity the fool who chooses to eat here."

I called them to let them know that their system may be jumping or malfunctioning.  The person who answered the telephone was extremely rude, and simply directed me to take it up with seamless.

The restaurant was packed on a Saturday night, but we were still able to get seated within 10 mins of waiting.  Servers were friendly and service was decent.  No complaints.The main staples I tend to order at every Thai restaurant is the tom yum soup and the salads, which I started off with as appetizers.  Both the shrimp tom yum soup and mango shrimp salad were tangy with a spicy kick to it.  The spice level is not volcano status but rather a mild level (or at least ask for mild if you can't handle spicy) so do attempt to get this!  It's good!  The sour spice will awaken your palette and leave you craving for more. For entrees, we got the pork tenderloin dish and a duck leg noodle soup. The pork was not only flavorful but tender and juicy as well, and served with a side of sticky rice. The duck noodle soup was rich in broth while the duck leg was very fatty but also tender. This is a nice restaurant addition to the busy neighborhood."

It has more of a ginger taste to it. The Thai ice tea was awesome!! They gave it in a huge mason mug! The service was excellent and you wouldn't think there was a Thai restaurant there. Parking was not as easy to find but we found one. They didn't take Amex which was a bummer. They sat at us at a booth with a huge marble table that I felt far away from my friends but it was cool. Big enough to have all your dishes on the table. I would definitely go back to try other dishes.

It was worth the visit just for those!We had a reservation for four, but my friend and I arrived an hour early, so naturally we got a head start on appetizers. We tried the aforementioned puffs, the spring rolls, the calamari, and the fried tofu. The others ranged from okay to good, but the puffs were the only thing we doubled up on after trying. There's not much to dislike about the dish!Later, once our other friends got there, we got entrees for ourselves. I went with the spicy pork knuckes, which advertises two different heat sources. They weren't lying: it's hot. The pork itself was tender with the right amount of chewiness, and our free check-in lychee mimosas helped offset the spice.The menu at Kitchen 79 is giant, and filled with items you won't find at your typical Thai restaurant. For that reason in itself I'd be happy to return, but it doesn't hurt to know I've got some curry puffs waiting for me as well."

At first the waiter seemed agitated and annoyed but as time passed, he began to be more attentive.  The woman waitress was much friendlier as she made sure we were taken care of and answered any questions we had. Let me begin by saying that the Thai Iced tea was huge and was mediocre-I've had better! Food was great! Coconut soup was a bit watery but still enjoyed it. Tom Yum was delicious but wished more vegetables were added. Steamed snapper was cooked well until we realized it wasn't scaled thoroughly. Otherwise, it had good flavor. Khao Pad rice  with tofu was delicious-wished it had more eggs. Duck was great as well-worth trying!For desserts, we had fried ice cream and coconut ice cream. Fried ice cream was okay as I've had better and coconut ice cream tasted just like a coconut with pieces of flakes added.Overall, I will definitely return to try other items:)"

I think this had tons of MSG in it or something because when I got home I couldn't stop drinking water.  Either way, tasty noodle soup dish!For dessert, we got a crazy fire presentation of fried ice cream.  The batter was a bit too thick for my liking and it was soaked in some very strong alcohol from the fire.  Yikes.  Probably the only hiccup of the evening.  That, and I could barely taste the flavor in the ice creams.Excellent authentic Thai food for the price and very large servings.  Would come here again."

The food was still good. I like how their Thai/Green Iced tea is served in such large cups. However I do prefer the iced tea elsewhere (Dek Sen, Chao Thai). I was most excited to order the lychee creme brûlée as that was my ultimate memory from the previous visit. I was unfortunately disappointed when they just dropped the check on our table and didn't tell us the kitchen was closing. Normally the staff warns you in advance and asks if you'd like to order anything else, but they just said the kitchen was closed after we said we wanted to order dessert. I know the creme brulees are premade in advance. You just dust it in sugar and torch it. I'm a bit miffed by this since this was the only reason I came here but aside from this, everything else was still good."

I loved the somtum thai, it was fresh, well-seasoned and delicious. I enjoyed it so much, I ordered a second one to take home. The pad woon sen was pretty delicious too, The glass noodles had plenty of flavor and were paried with beef, woodear, bell pepper, scallions, and other vegetables. The Thai iced tea came in a pretty big mug and was excellent as well. It was on the sweet side, but very good. The only dish I tried that was harder to eat was the gaeng tai pla (a curry dish with shrimp, mackerel and vegetables). The server warned that this southern thai style dish would be really spicy and a bit fishy. He was right, even though the heat was toned down by request, it was still hot and the mackerel flavor did permeate the dish. This dish would definitely be an aquired taste. Overall, wonderful food. Lots of options to choose from ranging from noodles, curry, curry, to sauteed and specialty dishes. I would definitely like to go back and try more menu items."

The Jackson heights and nearby Elmhurst area is flooded with Thai food, so there's a lot of competition in this cuisine in the area. However, I've tried Ayada Thai and SriPraPhai several times, unimpressed, I decided to give this place a shot.As others have said, this place feels much more upscale.. similar to a restaurant you'd find in the city.. but for much cheaper prices. The lighting inside is a little dark for my preference, but definitely enjoyable for a romantic date. I started off with a Thai tea.. because.. who goes to eat Thai food without enjoying a Thai tea on the side? (Did you really go to a Thai restaurant?) $3 is $.50-$1.00 more expensive than how much other places charge for Thai tea, but I assure you that the quality of this tea is one of the best in the area. The portions.. is.. fair, most of my cup was ice and nothing compares to the LARGE jug of Thai tea from Ayada Thai. We also had the calamari for appetizers which was underwhelming since the batter was not crispy.. it was actually quite soggy even though it was warm and evidently just came out of the kitchen.My go-to Thai cuisine, that I get at every restaurant without fail is Pad See Ew.. so I would say I am some type of Pad See Ew expert.. this, was done correctly. The noodles are soft but chewy, flavorful, not too oily, chicken was soft and not rubbery tasting.. and the portion was right. My friend had a curry option (I don't remember the name exactly) but he enjoyed it though it was not something he typically liked having (so that is a plus).Overall, I would love to come back. Great food for a great price, at a convenient location!"

Didn't wait too long as the delivery was real quick within 10-15mins, superb service! Thoughts on the food:-- Chicken Pad Thai was good, nothing special but the serving was enough for two. Ordered in ""mildly spicy"" but didn't feel any kick to it at all, I've tried better ones but for the price it's alright. Lunch special includes an entrée & a choice of appetizer.-- First time to try the curry puff. Very flavourful & it wasn't overbearing. I loved the soft buttery & crispy pastry, it's very similar to an empanada but with a curried mashed potato filling.-- Kanom Jeeb was pretty good. It's like a steamed chicken dumpling but twice the portion size. It went really well with the tangy sauce.-- THAI ICED COFFEE IS REALLY GOOD. Hands down the best thai iced coffee I've ever had so far!  In sum: 4 & 1/2  Stars. Good food, large portions, & quick service. Would definitely order from them again. Thank you!"

I ordered the phad Ka prow which was really good no the curry puffs which were also good but just softer than our normal Thai place. It's was $17+ for both.Glad they were open late. Just walked in to pick it up and they were very friendly on the phone and in person.

Their food is so delicious and flavorful. They also adjust spice levels according to your liking, which is amazing because I love spicy food. The chicken fried rice and the drunken noodles are always on the table when I go here. My cousin always takes advantage of their lunch special that I have yet to try. They are often very busy so some waiting might be involved. My only complaint is that there is a slight fish smell in the restaurant, but it's a small sacrifice to make for such delicious food. Please do yourself a favor and go here!"

This place was highly rated on Google so we came here for dinner today. The food was SO delicious. I had the crispy pork belly cooked in peanut sauce with white rice and it was SO good. The setting was dimly lit with lots of decorative (but not bright) lights and candles everywhere, marble tables and nice indie music. I will come here again next time I visit Jackson Heights and I will recommend this place to everyone."

(Just like every other Thai place) There was also a bar (I believe full service) Our server was nice, very attentive in filling the water glass.I ordered phaug tord (deep fried taro with a sweet chili sauce) and a tofu guay tiew pad see eiw. Both dishes were good, but not out of this world, haha. Prices were normal too."

It was fairly busy and there was only one waitress for all the tables. It took her a while to get to us and she was very impersonal so I bumped the rating down a star. My friends and I were seated at very uncomfortable seats. We felt like we were sinking in the seats. I had to sit at the edge of my seat to feel a bit more comfortable. I ordered:- Thai iced coffee (If you like your coffee bitter but sweet, you should try this)- Yum Ma Mong salad (Such a refreshing salad. It's a bit on the sour side but that's what makes it good)- Lychee Crème Brûlée (I'm always down for some crème brûlée. The lychee flavor added a nice twist to it and I definitely recommend)I must say that I am not big on Thai food. I feel like maybe it's because I always associate it with pad thai (so sick of it after eating it one too many times). However, I know I'll be back for more at Kitchen 79."

High quality, delicious food in a clean, comfortable restaurant. I came with 3 other people for a quick lunch, and their lunch special menu (served before 4pm) allows you to pick an appetizer as well as a main dish as part of your meal. My group ordered fried wontons filled with cream cheese and crab, salad with peanut sauce, red curry, green curry, basil fried rice, and pad thai. Everything tasted delicious, and the portions were perfect for lunch. There is plenty of seating inside, so I will definitely be bringing more friends along next time."

Started off with some apps, the Pla Muk Tord (calamari) crispy with a great sauce. Kanom Jeeb (friend dumpling) the sauce made them better but it drenched up more of the oil than I would have liked. The thai tea was great but would have been even better with some boba! We had a guay tiew rad nha noodle with chicken, the gravy made it better. And I liked a gauy tiew pad kee mau noodle better though. For dessert we had the lychee creme brulee, a MUST have SOO good creamy not too sweet, great consistency with pieces of lychee. Fried banana rolls with green tea ice cream was overall too sweet, maybe due to the honey on the plate also, but not bad. Cons: There's only about 12 tables inside and they don't take reservations for parties of less than 6. The parking is a little bit of a pain but that's jackson heights in general."

The food are also delicious. Especially The Tom Yum Fried Rice, it is the best dish ever!! Really recommended to try. Khao soi is the dish that comes with both  fresh and crispy noodles, which makes it so unique and  the soup was rich and flavorful. We finish our meal with the Lynchee Cream Brulee, and we Win ;)Definitely come back!!The Thai Ice Green tea is also yummy."

The menu is great, so many dishes to choose from. A lot of Thai places don't have such a big variety, but Kitchen 79 does. I love their service, everyone who works there is very nice and welcoming. It's a great spot to take your friends, or a date. My favorite drink to get is the Thai Iced Tea; their choices in drinks are pretty limited.My favorite dish is the Phad Ka Prow, with shrimp. I love spicy food, and whenever I ask them to make it ""extra spicy"", they deliver! Definitely recommend this spot to Thai lovers."

The food was great the apps were tasty and the decor was cool. The staff was friendly and accommodating to our large party of 13. They made us feel welcome and at home. Tried the glass noodles and was satisfied.

The restaurant is intimate and cozy. We ordered calamari, curry puffs, pad see ew, and the pad kei mao. The calamari was crispy and came with a delicious dipping sauce. The curry puffs were okay in my opinion. They are served with a cucumber dipping sauce that I was indifferent about. I don't think I would order the curry puffs again. My pad see ew was good. It was a fair portion and I even had enough for lunch the next day. My friends ordered the pad kei mao and thought it could have been spicier. As someone who doesnt really eat spicy food, I would agree. The dish was very mild. If you like spicy food, I recommend asking them to make the dish spicier. Overall it was a good experience at Kitchen 79. The staff were accommodating and nice. Definitely would recommend.Note: It was freezing out the night we ate here. We felt a great chill every time the door was opened. next time we would probably ask to be seated further from the door. The restaurant is also conveniently located by the train station. I suggest taking public transportation instead of driving. Finding parking around here is a nightmare."

I always give at least15% tip. They added 18% gratitude because there's seat for5 people. The fifth person is a 2 year old who doesn't eat.  No place I've been to add tip like this.  The waiter looks at us and being Asian she probably think we won't tip.  I am so angry for this insult.  The tall skinny female waiter is very rude and extremely late at waiting you after you sat down.  The waiters were talking bad about our table when I asked them to fix the check for the added tip.  That is the most unprofessional service I've had up to this date.  Food was ok mainly sweet, good presentation. I've had better basil fried rice elsewhere.  The appetizers are decent but main course don't order too much because all you taste will be sugar. I was going to order desert but I'm feeling too sugary."

Service was excellent food was good except for the seafood noodle soup for which I did not mind the spice but the flavor doesn't have that 'wow' factor to it. The calamari and fried rice with the seafood dish was very good. Will visit again.

First of all, I've been hearing about this place for a long time. When I had to chance to go to New York, I had to make sure I made time to go here. Almost 45 min of metro from where we were staying but it was worth it. I went on a Sunday afternoon in between lunch and dinner time so we would miss the crowd but also because we woke up really late haha. Ambiance: I have to say it wasn't what I was expecting (in a good way) from a Thai restaurant. The set up and decor was modern and upscale but still had a comfortable feel to it. I took a minute or two when I first arrived just to look at the surroundings. Drinks: - Thai Tea (3 cups there, 1 cup to go)I don't think I need to explain this, I love Thai tea! They also have a full bar for those who might want alcohol or wine. Appetizers: - Fried Tofu- Steamed Dumplings (Kanom Jeeb)- Calamari- Tom Yum SoupThe first 3 appetizers are my go to whenever I go to any Thai restaurants. The fried tofu is pretty standard with good sweet chili sauce, tofu was fried well. The dumplings was also really nicely done and not all Thai places get it right. The calamari was also great, crispy on the outside, soft on the inside! My friend had the Tom yum soup and he really liked it. The appetizers were all great, we cleaned the plates and bowl.Entrees: - Shrimp Pad Thai- Roast Duck in Red Curry. Pad Thai is usually my go to whenever it's the first time I visit a Thai restaurant so I have a baseline to compare. It was well balanced, I would say slightly towards the sweet side which is my preference, so I loved it. Had to box some of it to take with me because of all the appetizers but it was still good later! The roast duck was fantastic. First of all, the plating was basically eye candy, you just can't help but snap pictures of it. And the taste did not fall short either, I definitely recommend everything we've had there. While we were there, I noticed the next table had order a whole fish, that's definitely something I will try next time I visit this place. Service: Awesome friendly service, food arrived at reasonable times, made good suggestions, made sure our glasses are never emptied, checked in on us on a timely manner. All in all, well worth the trip and hype! Definitely will be back to try other dishes!!"

The place is so nice and spacious with a beautiful touch of class. The decor is modern. The staff are friendly. The food is AMAZING bursting with flavors. My sister had ordered the crab fried rice, all I can say is wow! It's freshly made with crab meat and the flavors are superb. Never had it before till now. By far it's a new add on to my palate. Will definitely be coming again and recommending this to everyone."

I had my birthday party here and they were able to accommodate such a large group under their reservations. Everything from their appetizers to desserts was delicious. The deep fried soft shell scrab, the egg rolls, the fried whole fish, pad thai, duck curry, Thai iced tea, etc. Literally you could order just about anything and be completely satisfied with your meal. The place is beautiful with the arrangement of seats and tables and modern decor is sure to impress. I'm so glad to now have a go to Thai spot in queens! I only wish they had a parking lot so I could come by more often, but it is located near the train station so be sure to drop by, this place is a true gem!"

(Please indulge me with some dramatic license here.) But seriously, how I could be enjoying myself so shamelessly when all the while I was betraying my beloved Thai go-to, Sripraphai?  Clearly, I got over it:Anyway, our meal here was very solid.  The biggest standout was the ultra-fresh tasting Seafood Salad, which popped with lemongrass flavor.  Tofu-filled Summer Rolls were a nice, light, non-fried way to begin.  Cut into bite-size pieces, this was a very shareable starter.  Though the kid, a self-avowed tofu hater, managed to scarf down most of this.  Another dish worth mentioning is the Whole Fried Fish with Mango Salad. Though the fish was perfectly cooked, the Mango Salad lacked the bright herbal punch of Srip's version.  (Yeah, I went there).  Not worth $27 (!).This spot apparently prides itself on a focus on Southern Thai cooking, with a few menu options that fall into this particular category.  We tried a Southern Eggplant curry with Tofu that was very brothy with lots of heat (no coconut milk).  Honestly, there were a couple (Southern) meat-based choices that looked more intriguing, but we were with my pescetarian brother, so we accommodated him.I rarely mention service, unless it is exceptional in some way.  In this case, we enjoyed exceptionally gracious and helpful service, in sharp contrast to Srip's often impersonal, rushed variation.  Ambience here felt more zen too.Ultimately, this was just a dalliance. No matter how much I stray, I always return to Srip.  But this was no one-off.  I'll be back to explore some of the more meaty menu options sans my tofu, fish and seafood-centric brother."

The food made me physically ill. There actually was tissue paper that I found in my meal. Unknowingly, I ate some of this paper and had to vomit.

First off, it really is a nice space that's conducive to a pleasant evening out--even though I was here alone just getting off a flight. Ordered Khao Phad Ka Prow hot and on the latter I found it just right to my liking. Hate when you can tell they dumbed it down to mild because you don't look Thai (that'd be me, Mr. Midwestern white boy). Ordered with pork which while quite good, there was not a lot of it. Savory, nice peppy basil and onions and the rice was quite tasty, seasoned about right. I note that I arrived on a late flight and was eating at 4:00 p.m. which is a recipe for poor food and service and locations. Not here.I found this amusing and must pass it on: of course they serve Chang beer which almost any Thai restaurant with a liquor license will. They had bottles on display along with the wines, etc. The other prominent beer option? Here goes: Pabst Blue Ribbon... for those hipsters that just must I guess. Gross.Ah well, nicely done Kitchen 79. You've given the locals a pretty nice venue that has an intimate feel without having to leave the 'hood. If I lived here I'd be returning for sure.Overall:Restaurant interior/design: 5 starsFood: 4 starsService: 4 starsPrice: 3 stars ($11 for a plate of rice with a little meat... not overly impressed on this."

Kitchen 79 is a great addition to the multitude of Thai restaurants in Queens which includes one of my favorites SriPhaPhai. I came here with a friend for dinner on his recommendation and I've been meaning to try it out after his rave about it and he was right. The food was spectacular. I had ordered the wild boar with spicy curry paste and the server actually warned me it was quite spicy. Now, when it comes to spice, I always say I can handle it and then regret it afterwards. I actually debated whether or not to get a different dish but I'm so glad I stuck with my first choice. Thanks to the addition of the baby corn, Thai eggplant, and bamboo shoots for fresh vegetables, it toned down the spicy curry paste but it was still quite spicy. However, it was that really good kind of spice in spite of my low spice tolerance, I really enjoy. It burned but it burned good and still flavorful because of the basil leaves in the dish too. White rice helps as well.  As a specialty dish, it stands out.Our service was excellent throughout the entire meal thanks to the attentive staff. The decor is dark and modern with the the black brick interlaced with white throughout the space. Some of the seating arrangements are a bit cramped but compared to other places in Manhattan, you could do a lot worse. Go for the Thai food at Kitchen 79. Happy eating and remember: Don't deny, satisfy!"

I'm often looking to find great places in the neighborhood to change things up from time to time. I'm glad I remembered this place and gave it a try!The restaurant itself has a nice ambience. We sat at the booth in the back next to widow. The table was huge (especially for the 2 of us)! The other tables in the middle of the restaurant looked comfortable as well. Really enjoyed the music they were playing and appreciated that the volume allowed for conversation. The staff were all very friendly and accommodating. One of the dishes we ordered was mixed up, but they were quick to fix it with no problem.Now onto the food. We ordered an appetizer from their chef specialities menu (pictured). I don't recall the name exactly... mummy shrimp?... but it was delicious. The shrimp was skewered with a long thin pepper and they were wrapped in bacon. It had a good balance of spicy and sweet, especially when dipped into the accompanying sauce. It also had some greens and cherry tomatoes as a base. We also ordered pineapple chicken fried rice & beef pad sei eiw. We asked for extra paltes so that we could share and were very satisfied with our choices. Definitely recommend!"

This is an up and coming Thai restaurant in the neighborhood and its review status does not lie. With just three people at lunch special prices it came out to just over $10 a person - BUT the food and service and atmosphere and ambience is reminiscent of the restaurants that are visited by the upper echelon. We had the Papaya salad, green curry, pad see ew and curry puffs. Not one thing to complain about. Finished off the meal with green Thai iced tea and it was perfect. All of these are a must have. One of my first reviews in a long time but I felt as though it was necessary for an amazing restaurant like this. Support the small businesses!!!"

I thought the Pad See Ew was a bit sweet for my taste but I think most people would like it. I really like the Lychee Creme Brûlée and the presentation is pretty. I think it would be better if they put lychee jelly at the bottom instead of the canned lychee. Overall I did enjoy this restaurant and will probably go back again."

I visited Kitchen 79 on February 6th (almost three weeks ago...yes and I'm writing the review now) with the bf and it was REALLY pleasant. Here's why:We got there roughly around 3:52 pm as the trains took forever and yeah, a pretty LATE lunch. The $7.50 Chicken, Tofu or Vegetable and the $8.50 Choice of Shrimp or Beef lasted only until 4:00 pm. The friendly lady greeted us and gave us the lunch menu. It was 3:56 pm and she told us we only had a few minutes to put our order in if we wanted the lunch menu. Now she could've gave us a dirty look and pass us the dinner menu but she didn't. Thumbs up, thumbs up!! APPETIZERS--we chose the 'ka nom jeep' (steamed fried dumplings with minced chicken) and the deep fried spring rolls with mixed veggies and glass noodles. Those were appetizing for sure. I really liked it. I can't really 100% remember how it tasted like (I will make sure I write reviews on the spot or shortly after from now on)...but salivating nonetheless because I remember really enjoying it. I got the Pad Thai (always have to get the pad thai at every Thai restaurant as I said in my other Khao Thai review) and it was delicious. The portion was a pretty good size and I was stuffed. Can't forget about the huge mug of Thai Iced Tea for only $3. Oh boy. SO WORTH IT. The bf got shrimp Khao Phad Ka Prow. It was delectable as well.Service was superb (user experience is so important). The decor is another thumbs up. I was super pleased and I cannot wait to revisit!"

We were kindly welcomed and gracefully served by a welcoming and attentive staff. The place has a sexy look... good for a romantic date. Labb with pork: although the minced pork was tasty, the greens that came with it were cut too big, and never really mixed well with it. It felt like eating plain lettuce with meat on the side. Moo yaang (grilled tender pork): although the meat was tender, it wasn't as hot as it should have been; also, the sauce was uninspiring. Phed ma kham (roasted duck in tamarind sauce...$18): this sauce instead was very good, and the portion size huge; however, the meat itself was kinda tough, and the steamed veggies beyond boring.Overall, I only tasted three dishes, but because of the fact that they tend to be popular, they probably represented a general idea of the chef's skills. I found them ok, but with considerable issues that prevented them from being good. Despite the kind service, I'm not sure I'd come back."

A rather stylish, modern with mild remnants of the culture behind the cuisine. That and the Santa Clause in the glass that looks like a fancy dessert from afar.  Kitchen 79 has all the staples you are looking for from the curry puff & tom yum soup as starters to the pad thai, pad se ew & my go to....crab fried rice as the main dish.The two best dishes I've tried so far is the curry puffs and the crab fried rice. Both have a good mix of spices that don't overpower the pallet. The crab fried rice had multiple healthy chunks of crab cooked just right. Potions for prices are reasonable. A starter and main dish for dinner will be under $20, maybe slightly over with tax & tip.The most disappointing dish was the Tod Mun Goong (Shrimp Cake Fritter). While the sauce was excellent, the flavor was ok. Breaking into the outer layer was difficult since it had been fried to a crisp, but not burnt in any way. Maybe for other people it tastes better, but for me I wasn't a fan. Overall: 3.75 StarsSolid Thai food. Certainly not the best in the area, but it does the cuisine justice.Portions for the price are hard to beat (possible, but hard).Reservations are not necessary, but I recommend them between 700m and 800pm just in case.Ambiance is sleek modern and perfect for a romantic get together with your loved one.Kitchen 79 is worth a try.I seem to always have problems writing reviews for Thai restaurants these days. Sorry if it sounds bad.I also apologize for some of the blurryish pictures. I botched that up too."

The restaurant was fairly quiet with 3 other small parties. The hostess was very friendly and seated us in a large booth by the window. The food here is better than the more hyped place in Woodside; I actually prefer their food over the other one. We ordered the curry puff, beef salad, calamari and Wonton soup for appetizers. The shredded beef salad had a much more pleasing taste than other restaurants as it did not burn my throat eating it. Curry puff and calamari was tasty as well. We did not care too much for the Wonton soup, although my non-Asian husband loved it.For entrees, we had the chicken yellow curry, Singapore rice noodles and oven baked pork ribs. The curry was sweet in taste and excellent with their jasmine rice. Oven baked pork ribs had a tangy spicy sauce over the crispness. The Singapore rice noodles was too salty for my taste buds and we had a few uncooked Chinese vegetable stems in it that ruined the taste of the dish for me. Dessert was coconut ice cream and fried green tea ice cream. My daughter and husband devoured the coconut ice cream and fought over the last bite. The fried dough was crispy and delicious but the green tea ice cream was too hard - as if it was sitting in the freezer for too long.All in all, we would go back again!"

Since I live in Jackson heights I decided to give a chance to kitchen 79 and I don't regret it the taste of the tom yum soup is very real Thai and my second favorite dish green papaya salad I love the flavor the only thing I didn't like it's that instead of being full of green papaya it had cabbage which it's not my favorite. They have good lunch specials and happy hour wow

I'm definitely coming here again. It's about an hour and a half away from where I live and I'm coming here again. I arrived a couple minutes before my friend did. I was seated and given a menu while I waited. We had agreed to meet at 6:30 so the restaurant was pretty empty. (But boy did it fill up later on) I asked a waitress which Thai salad she thought was better and she went in great detail about the flavors and spice of each, which salad was most popular and which one was most authentic to Thai food. It was unexpected and much appreciated since my questions about dishes are usually responded with ""they are all good...'why do you think they're on the menu...duh'"". My friend arrived and we ordered the green curry, pork satay, green mango salad and the tom yum soup. Pork satay (B)The flavor was very good. It was super juicy and the peanut sauce and vinegar sauce that accompanied the pork were delicious as well. I would give this dish an A if the pork wasn't so chewy. I could barely eat the meat due to the really chewy fat. But great flavor. Mango salad (A)Omg this was delicious. I asked for spicy and they definitely gave me spicy. It was sweet and sour and salty. The shrimp was cooked perfectly and the mango was slightly sweet but had a great crunch to it. The cashews have a nice creaminess and small crunch and the spice was so spicy I started sweating, but it was fantastic and I loved every minute of it. Tom yum soup (A)Definitely one of the better soups that I've had. Tangy and perfectly sour. There was cauliflower in it which was surprising (but I love cauliflower so no complaint from me). I was able to get just vegetable Tom yum as well. Not as spicy as I would have liked but very very good. Green curry (B)Not the best green curry I've had, but not the worst. It was a little too watery for my liking. It wasn't spicy at all which I was a little disappointed about, but my friend is very sensitive to spice so it was perfect for her. She really enjoyed it and would give it an A. Each to their own. Great and very friendly service. Nicely decorated and there's a small little bar (seats about 5 or so people). Lots of mirrors and a nice ambiance at night."

Not too hungry, I started with Tom Kha soup and a green Thai iced tea. The Green tea comes out in this huge mug. It was delicious. My soup was perfect. So flavorful. Then I decided to try out the papaya salad. I was deciding on getting it with crab or not. The waitress was honest and real. So I ordered without crab and spicy. Another home run.

Decor was nice and modern. Really comfortable seats. Came here expecting cocktails but all they have is beer, wine and sake. Now, the food. Started with classic curry puffs but found them to be on the bland side. Tamarind duck was pretty good but nothing spectacular. Hate how they just throw some steamed vegetables on the side just to fill the plate. No flavor. Just straight up steamed vegetables. Also had the crispy pork eggplant basil but it was soooo good. Texture and flavor was all there. Fried green tea ice cream was mediocre. I'll give this place another chance solely based on the eggplant basil."

A very rare full 5 stars and they deserve it. Very authentic and a welcome taste. We had the very good Mango salad with shrimp, excellent Basil chicken and excellent (very spicy) Catfish special.

I have tried it twice and the food was delicious. I heard they specialize in southern Thai food whereas Ayada and Sripiphai specialize in northern Thai food. I tried Gaeng Tai Pla, a mackerel and shrimp soup, most recently and it was amazing. I didn't try any of the dishes that are more popular in America, but I'm sure they are good too.The most surprising thing to me about Kitchen 79 was how nice it was inside the restaurant. There are few restaurants in Jackson Heights that are trendy like this. And the prices are about the same as the other Thai places in Elmhurst and Woodside. I went on a Tuesday night at 9 pm and it was 3/4 full - cool  and not typical in Jackson Heights. I think it would be a good place to bring someone from out of town, if you want to bring them to a nice looking restaurant without leaving the neighborhood.One last thing. The spicy food is actually quite spicy. I was pleasantly surprised by the heat level both times. But if you aren't used to eating very spicy food regularly, be aware that this on another level."

It's very dimly lit place so as mentioned before its great for a date night. The food was nicely plated, flavorful, hot, and fresh. The price is perfect. We shared the lychee creme brûlée which was delicious and it was only $5! To be honest I would come here again."

Definitely very dark if that helps you get an idea. There are candles but you still can't really see your food if you're there at night. I just like to see my food. It's like a guessing game when it's that dark: ""Oh, some chicken... that's squid... hmm onion... nope a pepper!"" but everything tasted good so we made it through!Besides eating in the dark, the food was good but not mind-blowing to me. Not all food is or has to be though. Definitely solid food with fair prices and a more sophisticated ambiance.That being said, I do think there are a lot of other great places in the area. I personally prefer SriPraiThai, Ayada, and Arunee overall vibe and food wise. If you're looking for a Thai spot to bring a date, maybe this is your joint. It's dark enough she may not see that booger in your nose or that weird stain on your shirt you couldn't get out before leaving the house."

It's funny that I didn't like the drink before, but I guess I just never had well-made Thai iced tea. The mug was huge, and I could only finish half of it (a shame since it was so good). After looking through the reviews on here, I decided to order the duck noodle soup. The portion was fairly large (for me at least). It came with a nice and rich broth, thin rice noodles, and a large roasted duck leg. The waitress was very nice and attentive, offering me spicy condiments for the soup as well. There were four different condiments, and she recommended the spicy red paste for my dish. The servers were very nice to me, and gave a smile whenever they passed by, which I really appreciate.I will definitely come back here again.

You get a fairly wide selection of starters--options cover one side of the menu--and the main courses are listed on the other side. In addition to the typical offerings, these guys offer quite a few alternatives for the jaded Thai food enthusiast. Spelled out with Thai script and names, some menu items sound unfamiliar but are actually dishes we know well.It's not just the Thai iced coffee and tea that are big--the food portions are pretty generous too. Decor is tasteful, and the cushioned seats are comfy and inviting. The only distractions were the ""old digs smell"" when you first walk in, and the black tape used to patch up the bench cushions. Our waiter was friendly and accommodating.Yum Woon Sen - 4.5 starsExcellent balance of flavor. Maybe they toned down the tanginess, but I took a half star off because it lacked a little punch.Ka Nom Jeep, fried chicken dumplings - 4 starsDespite being a lunch special appetizer, its texture and sweet tangy sauce were surprisingly satisfying.Pad Thai - 3 starsDrenched with sauce. Not a good version of the classic.Guay Tiew Pad Sei Eiw (a.k.a. Pad See Ew) - 3.5 starsAlso heavy on the sauce and very salty. This version lacks breadth of flavor.Khao Phad, fried rice - 3.5 starsNot bad. Avoid ordering it with beef. It was incredibly leathery.Gaeng Kiew Warn, green curry with crispy pork - 4.5 starsThe crispy pork is similar to Chinese roasted pork belly, and is a refreshing choice of meat for all curries. The curry itself is pretty standard in taste--nothing wrong with reconstituted paste--but the bamboo shoots, peppers and meat were quality ingredients. Lots of novel items on the menu to try, so we'll be back!"

Please order their Geoy Hoy Cheese- it has crab meat and cream cheese, yes it's freaking delicious- it's one of the best things they have to offer! And please make sure to order their Thai Iced Tea!

I can tell that they were understaffed especially with the holiday rush but the servers did their best to accommodate our needs. We ordered the following:1. Fried calamari ($7) & fried wontons ($5/5pcs): They were so great. Crispy and not overly oily or fried. We inhaled it all. 2. Chicken pad thai was perfectly done. Texture was on point with enough flavor and sauce to go around. 3. Beef masaman curry: For the first time, I think I've gotten more beef than the curry itself. Beef was a little tough and could have been more tender. 4. Beef pineapple fried rice: The flavor was not what I was used to in other thai restaurants. It was odd and we all couldn't even take a second bite. It was much better the next day when I refried it with egg and some kitchen. 5. Shrimp drunken noodles: The flavor was nice and spicy and the shrimp was big and succulent. 6. Asian broccoli with pork: I loved how the pork actually tasted like pork belly with it's tender flesh and melting fat unlike a lot of other thai places. It could have been a little less salty but overall, it was good. Shout out to our waitress! You really made our Mother's day dinner a pleasant one!"

The inside is clean and nicely furnished. The service was wonderful! Now onto the food...Pla Muk Tord - Crispy Calamari, amazing amazing amazing. Get this! There is a substantial amount of calamari and it is not drenching in oil, unlike other experiences I had. Som Tum Thai Salad - Refreshing. The peanuts with the papaya, make the perfect marriage. Khao Phad Nuea Poo - Best fried rice I had ever, and the crab meat did not have that rubbery texture. I recommend it!Gaeny Dang Curry - I have never had green curry. This dish made me a lover of it. The dish way flavorful and milky, but not heavy. Pad Thai Noodle with beef - I recommend getting this classic dish! You know if a Thai restaurant is good if their Pad Thai dish tastes good. Gauy Tiew Yen Ta Fo Noodle- The waitress gave us some background information about this dish, which I very appreciated. She told us how the dish is more on the sweet side, which can throw people off. The dish is definitely something different, oh and the broth is pink! The fishballs were the highlight of this dish.Suki Talay Noodle- Huge portion, can be shared with 2-3 people. The mussels tasted fresh. This is a good dish overall. 7 dishes for 4 people came out to roughly $80 and full bellies, come here soon!"

The decor doesn't exactly take you on a journey to Pattaya but it doesn't matter, this place is all about the food. Excellent presentation,  reasonably priced, family run by folks who spoke to my Thai girlfriend in her native tongue. Much better than other spots nearby at very similar prices. The Tom Yum soup was the best I've had, very rich broth and nice and spicy. Steamed whole fish was beautiful and delicious.  Glass noodle salad was excellent,  and I'm not sure what they did but the wood ear mushrooms (often rubbery) were soft and flavorful. Attention to detail was present though out the meal. Again, a hidden jem that gets a little fanfare. Can't say enough about what an terrific experience I had."

So can you imagine how excited I was when I saw this restaurant pop up under the ""New Businesses"" section? I bookmarked it immediately and patiently waited for the day to come.It was a bit hard to find parking as this neighborhood is quite bustling but just as we were about to give up after going around like four times, we found one. I walked in with my food buddy (aka husband) and were immediately greeted by a friendly lady who seated us. We were served water and given a regular menu as well as the lunch special menu. I love that they have lunch specials even on the weekends! However the menu is so overwhelming because there are so many options! My husband ordered a lunch special ($7.50) that comes with one curry puff and the pad kee mau with chicken. I ordered a Thai iced tea, the calamari, and the panang curry with chicken.Wow! My fellow Yelpers were not kidding when they say the Thai iced tea is humongous because it really is! One order here is like 2-3 in other Thai restaurants. It is definitely on the sweeter side but that is how I like it and honestly probably the best one I have ever had. I don't usually like curry puffs, but this one is really good and super tasty. The calamari was battered and fried nicely, but I did not care too much for the dipping sauce. The pad kee mau was flavorful and delicious, but can use more heat in my opinion. The panang curry is the real winner here. It was savory, a bit sweet, and yet packed just the right amount of spice. Pair it with some jasmine rice and you got yourself a perfect meal. Deee-licious!I don't care too much for the decor as I found it to be questionable. It has a ""Dark Note""-esque feel to it (for all my anime nerds). Everything was colored either black or white, and they definitely went tile-happy with the floors and the walls.. all either black or white of course. Then there is the splash of fun with the abstract mirrors and a bit of industrial charm with the light fixtures at the bar. I cannot forget to mention the very interesting and confusing clock on the wall which poured water into a lit cup. Perhaps it is saying it is time for a drink? My husband said the clock had figures of people falling/dying and a random salamander, but I cannot vouch for that as I was too distracted by the creepy fake white bird on the bottom of the clock looking at me eat it's cousin (aka the chicken) in my dishes. I honestly think the decor might not have worked for me because I went during lunch time when the sun was still out, I'm sure it looks much more trendy in the evening.Overall, I would absolutely come back. This has one of the best Thai foods I have had in New York. Plus the prices are good and the service is excellent. Can't wait to come back and try other things on the menu!"

Staff are really very sweet. I love how they never let my water glass get empty. Usually when I go to Thai places I have to ask for refills of my water, which can get annoying tbh, but not here! Love the look, the chairs are so comfortable ! They're not typical wooden cheap chairs. And the food is YUM! I had the pad kee Mao with shrimp and it was perfect! Would've preferred a bit more bell peppers but it was very delicious. Appetizer I had the cream cheese dumplings which were mouth watering ! I wish I had ordered more. And the tofu for appetizer was really realllly good. So surprised how good those apps were ! And for desert I had the fried ice cream with coconut ice cream and wow was that good.

Well, Kitchen 79 is still new so we'll see how it fares after a little more time in the oven."

I  have been a regular customer for almost a full year and not only has the restaurant never disappoint, but it has met or exceeded expectations almost every time.  The other day I came with my boyfriend to Kitchen79 and I had another spectacular evening. For appetizers, we ordered the tod mun goong, which was crispy and delicious. Thhe texture was great. For the main course, we ordered the steam fish with spicy lime dressing and the spicy glass noodles with lime juice.  both dishes were on point and the portions were great. they even offered a spicy kit set. This chef is special because the food here will make you crave for more.I would also like to add that the quality of the food, the impeccable service, the comforting atmosphere, and the reasonable pricing all make this restaurant a number one priority."

Nice selection of menu. Big thai ice tea serving. The smell is what bothered us. Something smelly like a restroom kind a cleaner or something coming from that place! I still give it a 4 star! I will definitely come back again when im craving for thai.

Extremely recommended. My co worker recommended this Thai place just opened up a few mouths ago. We went there today with high expectation. Everything is beyond our expectation. The owner is very friendly and helpful with the menu. He recommended the dishes that other Thai restaurants don't have. We tried southern style Shrimp curry which is very spicy but we are gratefully enjoyed. Also big leg Duck Noodles Soup OMG absolutely amazing!!!! Everything is perfect. Modern sparkling decor makes this place outstanding unlike other Thai places. In Queens where you can find lots of Thai restaurants BUT this one is finely outstanding with authentic southern Thai style that I confirm everyone will love. P.s. Don't try just pad thai. Do try something different. You will LOVE Kitchen 79 ;)

I came here with a group of friends to celebrate my girlfriends birthday. To our amazement it had a very intimate vibe and welcoming atmosphere. We sang Happy Birthday about 5 times and enjoyed every moment with everyone celebrating a birthday that night. They were very accommodating, when I realized I forgot the candle for the cake, they were kind enough to to provide us with one . Now to the good stuff ..... We ordered a ton of appetizers curry puffs, calamari , crab cakes and lobster and cream cheese wontons ( all equally delightful ) . As for the  entrees we ordered pineapple fried rice and pad see yew both with chicken and shrimp (YUMMY!). The portions were a decent size (we were able to bring home lunch for the next day).

The hostess on the phone told me to not be more than 15min late or we would lose our seatings, which was reasonable. Typical rule for most restaurants. However, when we arrived, we were seated by the hostess BUT the tables weren't ready for 10 people. Our waiter looked at me with confusion and asked if we reserved in advance (actually he didn't look at me - there were no eye contact during this discussion). I responded that I did - for 10 people and reserved the seats for 6:30. Fine...no big deal. Now we didn't get enough water for everyone..I asked for another. We didn't get enough utensils..I asked for another. We ordered...never received our Pad Thai when we nearly finished all of our plates. I felt like I was in elementary school...raising my hands patiently...to get service...it was quite ridiculous! I cant blame on the waiter. He was constantly working. The whole place was packed and there were only 2 waiters!!! 2 waiters - to seat the guests, to answer phone calls, to work in the car area, to grab orders, to clear up the tables...you get the point? Nice presentation on the food but service was below par. If they didn't automatically take 18% gratuity, I would not have given them closed to that amount. This place is not good for groups.1. Appetizer - Calamari was delicious2. Appetizer - Curry Puff was not bad. Slightly greasy3. Entree - Soft shell crab - fried perfectly. Definitely not worth $20 for 2 crabs4. Entree - Fried whole fish with mango salad. Nice presentation. Fish was delicious5. Chicken Pad Thai - you can never go wrong with this!6. Crab meat Fried Rice - delicious7. Khao SOI noodle soup - This good too!8. Pad Ped moo phase (wild boar) - Too spicy! 0 out of 10 people gave it more than 0 scoreLike I said nice presentation. Poor service. Would be nice to welcome the guests with eye contact than constantly looking down - waiter seems agitated having us. Definitely not group friendly. 1-3 guests...would be a different story. They looked stressed out!OOoO, need to change credit cards on Yelp to DO NOT TAKE AMEXDefinitely had better Thai food elsewhere! Im very disappointed. Definitely not a 4.5 starts material as indicated on Yelp. Will not come back...Sorry Kitchen 79. First impression is last impression"

Cute hidden gem in Queens if you ever get the cravings for Thai food. Food was good, perfectly filling and plated very nicely. But I think the best part was the price, was only $11 for the lunch special! You get an appetizer and entree included. WOW. great food for SUPER cheap. The chicken wanton soup I had was fantastic, the broth was tasty and the wantons tasted like they were made fresh and had a slight cilantro kick to them. Mhm my favorite item off the the menu.

It was tasteless except for the curry in one of the sauces and the amount of protein in my dishes- shrimp and chicken was barely enough. I had the food last year and it was very good. I cannot understand the high rating based on last night's experience. Maybe the ownership changed or the chef was on vacation. Sad as I love Thai.

Why haven't I found this gem before? It was my daughter's birthday so we decided to take her out. They were so busy that we had to wait for 10 minuets even after making a reservation a week ago.

It is an interesting combination but no complaints since food is good and prices are OK (prob more expensive than other restaurants in the area though).Phed Ma Kham (roasted duck in tamarind sauce) - is not too sour and very generous portion on the duck. Texture of duck was excellent.Labb Gai (ground chicken salad) is also recommended (but maybe just slightly too salty for my taste.) Smells like it has fish sauce but I don't think it is indicated in the menu, so be sure to ask if you are allergic to fish sauce.The manager's Thai accent is really cute!

I guess I should have walked out when I saw the place was full of white people... I prefer the real deal and not food dumbed down for white people taste buds.That said they also don't know how to cook. My husband ordered the Duck in Red Curry....the duck was soooo chewy that the effort needed to eat it wasn't worth it. I sent back my Tom Yum soup because I thought they brought me the wrong soup...it was sweet!!! They assumed since I am white I wouldn't want it spicy...they came back with the same soup with Hot sauce in it. Service was also bad - people come and plop down a dish and walk away...no mention of what it is or if you need anything.The only thing I can think of that makes this place likable is the nicer decor than the other places in the hood. Arunee is 1000x better and is not even truly authentic thai...but not as ""white"" as Kitchen 79."

Food was good. The service was adequate. The problem with highly rated yelp restaurants is that your  expectations are so high that it never meets the expectations.  I went for lunch and had one of there set lunch menus.

The reviews for this place were spot on, just like the Wall Street Journal article. In our quest to find Tom Yum noodle soup, this is as good if not better than the ones in Bangkok. The Tom Yum noodle soup had everything I wanted, the perfect amount of heat, the minced pork and peanuts to give it the noodle soup its texture, and the smoothness of the noodles. Although the journey to Queens is a bit off the far end, I would recommend anyone coming here for authentic Thai. I can also say with a straight face that the other dishes are just as good. Although there wasn't much room left in my tummy, I wouldn't mind ordering all this deliciousness back to the city. 5 out of 5 on this one. Keep it up Kitchen 79!!!"

Our waitress was super knowledgeable and offered suggestions when she saw I could use it.We ordered the calamari, basil rice w shrimp, and green curry chicken. Everything was excellent!

This space now occupies where Arunee Thai used to be and has been completely renovated from head to toe. The space, now, features an interesting full black and white, almost Alice in Wonderland theme complete with a rams head clock and b&w tiled flooring, tables, and chairs.Lunch specials are completely worth the price at $7.50 for chicken, pork, tofu or $8.50 for shrimp and beef. Specials come standard with a choice of appetizer and entree. The lunch portions are generous with many different options to choose from. We had the Pad See Ew with Beef fried spring rolls. Pad See Ew was not overly oily and had a subtle bell-pepper flavor. I had the curry pineapple fried rice - very fragrant and well-seasoned fried rice. Can't really go wrong here. Curry puff appetizer was more or less a curry empanada served over a small salad. Thai Iced Tea was not cloying but served in a huge mug - delicious! Service is very homey and nice; We were greeted, seated, and waited upon with such genuine care and compassion. They checked up on us without being overbearing and made sure our water was filled constantly. Currently, closes at 11PM but they are waiting for their liquor license to arrive in a few weeks before pushing back the hours. I saw that they had 6 different types of beers on tap behind their bar so the alcoholic in me is excited! More to come as this place gets busier and busier - welcome to the neighborhood!"

So we thought!  I was the first to show up and was greeted by friendly staff.  Sat by the bar to wait for the rest of the group.  While I was debating whether to order Thai ice tea or not, a cold glass of water was placed in front of me.  I was impressed and grateful for that simple offer/service while I waited.  When the rest of the party arrived, we took quite a moment to decide as there were too many choices to choose from.Finally decided on calamari (Pla Muk Tord), mango salad (Yum Ma Mong), flat noodles w/chicken and squid (Guay Tiew Khua Gai) and deep fried fish (Pla Toad Yum Ma Mong).  Can I just say, we cleaned out our plates!!!! Everything was so good!  The calamari was just right, lightly breaded & seasoned.  The mango salad was sweet, savory, a lil on the spicy side & perfect.  My friend really wanted the mango salad AND papaya shreds, so for a small addtl $ they added it for us without grief.  If you're the type to stay safe and order Pad Thai, please, be adventurous and get the Guay Tiew Khua Gai.  You won't regret it. Promise.  And last but not least, the FISH!  It was soooo sooo good that the only thing left on the plate was part of the head/a bit of the tail.  Some might be weirded out by it but I'm sure you'll do the same when you get there.  Highly recommend this spot for your tummy and chic decor for your eyes.  Oh and they make a killer white sangria!"

It is one of the best Thai food restaurants out here in Jackson Heights, Queens. I been here twice and the food has not disappointed me. The mango salad was fresh and spicy.  The pad sew ew was on point very delicious and tasty. My sister had the pineapple fried rice. It had curry which made it taste better and she was very satisfied with the taste and the portion size.  I also tried their banana beer: it's very good and aromatic.The Thai ice tea comes in a mug. I will definetely be back to get some in the summer time. I also love the dessert menu:  must try the creme brulee of lychee: so different but tasty. The decor was very modern and the atmosphere is perfect for a date or a girls night out. Excited to try out more of their menu."

We both like our dishes spicy. So we went in and ordered our basil fried rice and drunken noodles. We asked for it to be spicy. That was a mistake! It was sooooooooooo spicy. After two spoons we were crying and couldn't eat anymore. The staff was so polite and was nice enough to change our dishes and made it regular. This time around i wasn't able to eat it because everything was burning lol. I took it home an it still taste great.  The staff was pleasant. The place is clean and the food was great. I gave it four stars because it's important for people to know how spicy is spicy. The staff should inform the guest before they place the order.

The last location sometimes lacked the hygiene that is expected of such a popular restaurant, but their new location is both clean and has the quality of the food. Wait times are minimal for such a popular restaurant, and food comes timely after you order it. The soup dumplings are known by anyone who lives in flushing, and they are a must get. Their chow mein tastes like any other place's chow mein, but all chow mein is great. Would definitely recommend to any visitors and if you are a local and haven't eaten here, what are you waiting for?"

Are they going to use the pandemic as an excuse?  The skin was thick and doughy, not cooked through, didn't stay on the pan frying long enough, and not much filling, even the dollar dumplings stalls are better than this!  I don't expect that from a Michelin rated restaurant as they proudly advertise with the postings all around the restaurant.  I could of went with a higher rating but how can you mess up something so simple like pan fried dumplings?!?"

Unfortunately, the quality and ambiance of the new store is catered much more to tourists and non-locals. Try the new tri-colored Xiao Long Bao but it definitely isnt the same. The cold dishes and the soymilk are the sleeper trys here. Sad that their expansion doesn't bring forth the same quality or ambiance that their small store across the street once did.I nostalgically remember going to their original stores with my friends after work and just catching up with good food and good drinks."

As a person who lives far away from ""real Chinese food"". I have to say I was so excited when I was in Flushing seeing all the busy restaurants and stores. Xiao Long Bao is incomparable. I love it so much. The only downside is that this was a quite popular place. So the waiting hours can be very long."

The name of the restaurant remains a classic but the restaurant has made some great exterior upgrades. They opened up their new location just down the street from the previous restaurant. The new place is very different, with 2 floors and everything looks nice and brand new. It feels like a more upscale restaurant. Can't say enough about how nice they made their new restaurant. Another thing is their service has gotten better as well. The servers at the previous location were curt and not very friendly.The food quality has gone down just a bit. Overall, they serve very similar menu items. I would definitely recommend the Signature Pork XLB. I also like the Crab Meat XLB, but I am usually the only one in my group that likes these. I think the Lucky 6 is an interesting concept and a good looking picture, but most of the other types of baos taste pretty similar. For instance the scallop one only had a small piece of scallop in the middle of the same pork meat bun. The truffle one tastes interesting but all in all, I'd still go for the classic pork baos. Also, be ready to wait for a long time to get seated. They don't take reservations. It's located in One Fulton Square, and is walking distance from the main parts of Flushing. Overall, I miss the food from the previous restaurant, but enjoy the overall feel of the new one better."

I came here with my family on the weekend of Lunar New Year. On a cold and rainy winter day, this place provided comfort in the form of some tasty Chinese food. I also enjoyed the lunar decorations on the first floor. We got a variety of dumplings, appetizers, noodles and desserts. My favorite item was the noodle and beef with shredded pepper (no soup), robust and flavorful with a slight kick. If you're in the area, it's worth checking out."

This new restaurant is bigger and cleaner. For 2 people, we waited 40 mins on Saturday for lunch. We got the original Pork Soup Dumplings and a sampler 6 different flavors. The dumplings came quick but luke warm as if it's been sitting out for a while... Each dumpling had a good amount of broth. Nothing beats the classic pork. It tasted exactly how I remembered except the dough is now a bit thicker.  Their new flavors were overall okay. I wouldn't get them again. The scallop had a whole piece of scallop! The chicken was mild. The truffle was good but with only a hint of truffle. The gourd had a slight crunch and the crab was very fishy. There's a $30 card minimum which I guess is better than not accepting cards at all. I can see myself returning often."

Nan for short, ALWAYS has a long ass line, so I'm always like "" Nope we are not waiting!"". This week, by some weird phenomenon - there seemed to be no line in Nan and come to think of it, Flushing looked eerily empty. We jumped on the opportunity to get us some soup dumplings...=)Boy were we happy! The Lucky Six and the Signature are what was needed to satisfy our dumpling cravings.

It was busy as expected from reading the rest of the reviews. We waited about half an hour which wasn't as bad as we expected it to be.We got the Husband and Wife Special and two orders of the Lucky Six Soup Dumplings so we both got to try each of the flavors they had to offer. The Husband and Wife Special is sliced beef and tripe served in an oily spicy sauce. A very good appetizer to start out your meal. The main reason to come here though is their famous soup dumplings. They had various flavors to choose from and we couldn't decide on which to get so we got the Lucky Six Soup Dumplings. This included Signature (white), Crab Meat & Pork (white with orange tip), Black Truffle (purple), Chinese Squash (green), and Scallop (orange). The Black Truffle was the least soupy as it's essentially truffle oil and you know how expensive truffle can get. My favorite was the scallop. The most interesting one was the Chinese Squash as it tasted like Chinese squash, although there is pork in it.Overall a very wonderful experience. I read that this place was cash only, but that is a lie as they gladly took my credit card as payment. Gotta get those travel points so I can eat more food!"

The really big difference though, is that all the other dishes here are also good, whereas the non-xlb dishes at Din Tai Fung can be uninspiring. The fried 蔥油餅 are crispy, flaky, and chewy. The 生煎包 are crispy and juicy, if not exactly filled with soup. Even the appetizers, such as beans and tofu or beef tendon and tripe, are thoughtful and well-executed."

For a taste of everything soup dumpling wise, order their Lucky Six Soup Dumplings where you get one of each of the follow dumplings: crab, pork, chicken, black truffle, chinese squash and foie gras.Parking will be tough street wise but there's a parking lot nearby where you can park using the meter.

Still on prince street except down the block. Definitely a lot of options for soup dumplings and boy are they juicy!!! I opted to share the truffle soup dumplings and while I tasted the truffle in the soup dumplings, I wasn't particularly impressed. The little bits also reminded me of black sesame. I also tried their Pan Fried Pork Buns and they're super doughy but still very juicy. The rice cake with cabbage and pork was delicious.  I guess for flushing prices, this soup dumplings spot may be a bit more by like a dollar or two difference but it's honestly worth trying. I wish I came with a larger group to sample more dishes. Also this is cash only! Didn't see any atm inside the restaurant."

The places I go usually has a bit of kick to it and this one didn't.We got the soup dumplings again and I really wish they can work on their chili oil here. The dumplings would taste so much better if they just fix the chili oil. Their chili oil, not sure if it is bought or they make it, but the chili oil itself is just too thick. It has too much seeds and not enough oil or kick. Joe's has really good chili oil and so does Mimi Cheng's - if they can replicate their chili oil, then this place would improve tremendously.We also got the steamed fried buns - we didn't care for this dish at all, the filling wasn't good and neither was the wrapper.Chili Pepper and Pork Noodle Soup - it was cold, so I wanted something brothy and ordered this and again, standard but we did enjoy it. The meat was tender and nice, and flavour was good.Overall, not the best soup dumplings I ever had, since the wrapper should still be more delicate and filling can be more flavourful and definitely work on the chili oil recipe to make the dumplings better."

We got the salty tofu pudding which was very well done (so soft!). The stir fried rice cakes was also very well done.Maybe I'm not THAT into Shanghai food, I thought this place is good but overhyped.

They offered us to look at the menu and circle what we want so we can order right away when we got seated.We order three different soup dumplings. The lucky six, nan Xiang soup dumplings, and crab/pork. The nan Xiang and the crab meat one was good and very juicy. The lucky six was different but definitely worth trying. In addition we ordered the scallion pancake with sliced beef cause it was a pretty popular one on yelp so we gave it a try and I'm glad we did! It was delicious! We also orders the pan fried pork buns and pain fried pork dumplings. Both were good. For the noodles we got the pan fried crispy noodle.

We waited about 35 minutes for 2 to get a table.We ended up getting three dishes.  First,  A11. Fried Chinese Chives Box (Chinese Chives, Shrimp & Egg).  This came out piping hot and I almost burned the roof of my mouth.  Let it cool down a bit, but this had good flavor.  I also used it as an opportunity to try the chili paste and the siracha-ish sauce and taste test them.  Those sauces together are great and I used them a lot on the second dish too.Second, E9. Pan Fried Crispy Noodle w. Pork, Shrimp & Fish Fillet.  This dish was really good actually.  The crispy noodle was underneath the rest of the sauce and seafood. I highly recommend it.  The fish fillet was the best part.  Even some scallops ended up in the mix too. goes well with the sauces they place on the table.Third, F6.Lucky Six Soup Dumplings (6), which is a variety pack of dumplings: Signature + Crab Meat & Pork + Black Truffle + Chinese Squash + Scallop.  These were very good.  I think the black truffle was the most interesting of what I tasted. I also learned you drink the soup up from the top of the XLB instead of making them explode in your mouth, lol.All in all, the food and service were great.  We didn't feel that rushed to leave.  Pro tip - The entrance is on 39th street at ground level.  Don't try to enter from the exit that is up the stairs that you see off of Prince St.  They need a better sign.Pro tip 2 - Wash your hands after the bathroom.  Saw a bunch of people not do that as I was at the sink wiping the sweat off the top and back of my head. (from the temperature of the food, not the spice)"

Woot Woot!! The new location is much more modern and beautiful!  They do NOT take reservations, and this place gets packed!  First come, first served - you get a number (dim sum style) and your number will be called when your table is ready.  On this Friday night, 15 of us waited for a table and the wait wasn't terrible;  however, we got there early, at 5:45.  At first, we were told they may have to split our large group into two groups, but in the end, they managed to seat us all together.  Kudos to Nan Xiang for accommodating us! Of course, with the relocation and the booming Flushing rent, prices have gone UP!  Their menu has been refreshed to include old favorites as well as some new items.  No matter what you order, you're sure to be wow'd!  Everything is freshly made and delicious!Our shared menu tonight:~ Lucky Six Soup Dumplings (Signature + Crab Meat & Pork + Black Truffle + Chinese Squash + Scallop + Chicken) - I thought these were unique, visually appealing, tasty and fun to try but, honestly, I prefer their Signature pork soup dumplings the best!  Still, a must try at least once.~ Scallion Pancake w.Sliced Beef - these were outstanding and came with a delicious hoisin sauce. One of my fave dishes!~ Pan Fried Pork Buns - They make these one order at a time (literally), so if you order more than one order, they will not be served at the same time.  Standard dish but tasty!~ Husband & Wife Special (sliced beef & tripe served in spicy sauce) - cold appetizer; this was a great dish but I didn't really find it spicy at all.~ Chicken in Wine Sauce (Bone-In) - Good, but the wine flavor was very mild.  Good texture.~ Four Happiness Sponge Tofu (Braised Tofu served with bamboo shoots and wood ear mushrooms) - another cold appetizer.  Delicious dish!  Different and fun to try.~ Sticky Rice Sui Mai - I found this very bland but once you add a little chili oil to it, they were fantastic!~ Pan Fried Beef Dumplings - standard and ohhhh so satisfying.  Pan-fried to perfection.Overall, the quality and flavors of each dish were fantastic.  So many more items on their menu to try - I will definitely be back!  Service and hospitality were pretty good, considering how insanely busy it is in the restaurant.  Everyone is hustling!!  It was a little chaotic trying to serve 15 of us, but they did a great job on this busy evening.  Again, so glad that Nan Xiang has reopened!"

The inside is very different from the old location just up the block on Prince. The old spot was just like any other cheap low cost Chinese restaurant you would find in any Chinatown around the world. Quick bite and leave was the atmosphere in the old joint. The new Nan Xiang however is the complete opposite. I must say the inside is pretty damn nice compared to what it use to be. I actually wanna sit and take my time dining. The space in the new Nan Xiang is much more open, good lighting, very clean, excellent service, and reasonable wait time during a high capacity lunch hour on the day after Christmas.The food was more or less the same as the old spot. Some items tasted a little heavy on the msg. All of us became very thirsty on our way home. The scallion pancake with sliced beef is still pretty good. The soup dumplings tasted the same as before. I also ordered their pan fried noodles with seafood. It wasn't bad but it wasn't that great either. I wished it had more quality seafood, perhaps some scallops, squid, octopus, and larger shrimps. The noodles were pan fried well, good crunchy texture but it just lacked some of the key seafood ingredients.Verdict - The new Nan Xiang reminds me a lot of Din Tai Fung. The decor, lighting, wall fixtures, everything just seem like a copy of what Din Tai Fung does. And for a full disclosure, I am not a big Din Tai Fung fan to start with, I'm simply comparing the atmosphere between the two businesses even though they are not in direct competition with each other. The best part of Nan Xiang during this particular visit was the service. Our waitress was extremely polite and kind to our table. If you dropped your chopsticks, needed to refill yo ur water or tea, she was on it before you could even turn your head to realize she already done it. She was playful with my son, she was absolutely amazing and I didn't not expect this kind of service from Nan Xiang and from most Chinese restaurants in Flushing in general.The downside of Nan Xiang are two minor things that can be overlooked but is worth mentioning. Not enough restrooms. This new location can seat a lot of people and there always seem to be a long line for the restroom. Parking, for me this is not a problem because I don't mind parking at Sky View center and walk over to Prince St. But for those who wanna park are the municipal lot across the street from Nan Xiang, good luck!! Street parking is a disaster too due to the heavy construction around the block. Parking at the Sheraton sucks. So I would highly recommend parking at Sky View and take a short walk over, it's not that bad."

I remembered it was the best soup dumplings I ever had and I was so happy when I saw that it is open in NYC. I went there on Sunday late morning. The line is long but it is durable, 45 mins wait. Food - Obviously Soup dumpling is a must eat at this restaurant. However don't forget to try their pan fried pork buns! It is amazing. The skin is thin and the filling is so tasty. I ordered the Shanghai shu mai and It was meh.Overall I highly recommend this place. It tastes the same as the one in Shanghai"

This place does live up to their hype. We had to wait 30mins, but it was probably only 20min because people who put their name down ended up leaving so it we got seated faster. The food was made fresh, everything came out steaming hot and of course delicious.Pro:-Beautiful atmosphere-Great service. They are quick taking orders, refilling waters, and getting the check-The food is fresh and delicious. Every fish we got we enjoyedCons:-Long wait but worth it-Not really a con, but since the food is made to order you'll have to wait longer for it to come out so I cant really be upset here-Prices were kinda high and we splitted with a group of friends, but again it's still worth coming to try this placeTips:-Put in your name then walk around Flushing instead of waiting inside but come back a little early just in case people leave and they call your name earlier-Order one of everything and share/split with friends, family or your date"

What's new: more upscale atmosphere and higher prices. Nan Xiang was notorious for cheap, but delicious food back in its glory days. The service was subpar, but the food was delicious and quick. Service definitely has improved from before, and the entire ambience is a lot nicer, as the restaurant rebrands itself more on class. Doesn't feel as much as a hole-in-the-wall which was definitely part of its old charm. They have a new 6 XLB sampler with 6 different flavors. I'd say try it once, but it's definitely not a repeat purchase. The scallop one is their regular pork XLB with a mini scallop in the middle. The truffle one actually tastes like a truffle pork XLB, super rich and umami, I definitely would not be able to eat more than one. I'd recommend sticking to the pork XLB (definitely get the crab if you like seafood, I always preferred the crab over regular) and the Shanghai Udon. The shanghai udon is the perfect slightly greasy, but flavorful noodle dish with pork and bok choy. Great for sharing."

I see why Nan Xiang is Michelin recommended. Affordable but with amazing quality food. Their standard XLB is simple and perfect but the truffle XLB really blew me away. I never had anything like it. The truffle was very flavorful and really came through, I ate a whole tray myself. Anyway the scallion pancakes with beef was also the best one I've had, with the pancake being crispy and flakey, yet still soft and the beef being oh-so-flavorful.Now I can't go back to other XLB places :("

They took over Rong Restaurant's space at One Fulton Square. The renovation was gorgeous from the waiting area to the upstairs dining area. Damn, the restaurant was super duper packed when I arrived. Luckily, there was a guy in front of me waiting to get a ticket. When I got my ticket, holy moly #170 and the wait time was about an hour. Don't go by the TV monitor which kept saying now seating #41 when the guy started calling out numbers in the 100s SMH!  I grabbed a seat for my dad so he wasn't standing by the doors as we waited for my mom to come back from her errands. Apparently, there was a texting option but the guy didn't let me know about it until I found out 30 mins into waiting for a table.  I overheard a few people saying that there were plenty of emptied tables so why aren't they seating customers to speed things up. I was so annoyed that when a number was called and no one came forward you skip that number rather than going back to that skip number down the line...how rude!My parents and I waited for almost 2 hours. I don't think that I ever waited that long at their old location. I was frustrated like the other customers waiting there. Finally, the guy called #170 and we hurried through the crowd and went upstairs to be seated at our table.There was already a line for the restroom...ugh I have to wait even more! I came back to the table and my parents wanted to order food already because they were starving. I wasn't interested in their Lucky Six Xiao Long Bao at all which I have seen pictures on their Instagram. Wow, the food comes out quickly from the kitchen from the moment you place your food order. Food: A14. Red Bun Puff - hubba hubba *mama like* the flakiness and it was stuffed with a lot of red bean paste E7. Crispy Noodle with Seasonal Seafood - too many vegetables...barely any shrimp...not enough delicious crispy noodleF2. Steamed Crab Meat & Pork Xiao Long Bao - I am only a fan of this kind of xiao long bao...usually when I am sucking up the soup that it supposes to be HOT, not lukewarmB1. Pan Fried Pork Buns - usually when I bite into one of them...the soup would be bursting out of the bun B10. Vegetable Wontons - this used to be one of my favorites but not anymore because the taste isn't the same and broth of wonton soup was bland...comparing pictures from their old location to today's...huge difference ::sad face::E8. Rice Cake with Shredded Pork & Preserved Cabbage - this was a yummy dish but we were too stuff so we took the leftovers home What my parents and I ordered today was just a hit or miss. We definitely will be back to try the rest of the menu.Note: You will be spending more of your time just waiting for a table!"

There are three different types of Xiao Long Bao entrees. Signature, Crab and Pork, and their colored one that has different types of flavors (Signature, crab, black truffle, scallop, chicken, and Chinese squash). Another great dish is the ""Four Happiness Sponge Tofu"". Good flavor to it and not too salty. Their braised beef noodle soup was not worth it. Service was ok - they were very good at refilling your tea, but our waitress was rushing us to order when we first sat down. We didn't have any time to look at the menu and see what else they had."

I was never really a fan of Nan Xiang Xiao Long Bao. I came here back in November with a friend and the wait time was not bad... around 15-20minutes. Service was prompt and servers came around to constantly offer tea refills.Appetizer:Jellyfish with some vegetable I forgot the name of- oily Colorful soup dumplings- I couldn't taste the flavors that were listed on the menu except for the truffle and the crab ones. The truffle one had a lot of truffle flavor which was really nice. I would definitely come back solely for the truffle soup dumplings.Fried Noodles w/ Chicken- portion is biggg. Couldn't finish. It was ok.

There will almost definitely be a wait (around 30 mins on a Saturday night around 9pm), but it's worth it. We ordered the pork XLB, crab XLB and the shanghai pan fried udon noodles. Of the dishes, the crab XLB was my favorite.The skin of the XLBs here are very thin but held up well. It also was not soggy and there was a good amount of meat in each. The shanghai noodles tasted pretty normal, but the good noodle quality was noticeable (very firm but also chewy).The new location itself is very clean and the service is pretty friendly / quick. You can see people making the XLB near the seating area which is a nice touch. I would definitely recommend this spot if you are around Flushing as they are also open quite late. My only suggestion would be to fully utilize the screen they have to call out numbers as the lady who was shouting numbers was sometimes hard to hear since the restaurant can be a bit noisy, but would also call out incorrect numbers at times since I guess she couldn't read some of the handwriting causing some confusion."

The skin is dry and the soup inside is very fatty. We tried the colorful new dumplings which are unique. The truffles and chicken ones were great. I think you can only get them if you order the colorful variety though. Service was good in that they fill your tea often but they also take away the plates quickly when i wasn't done with the sauce. They seems to rush you out and put down the bill before i finished my last dish.Come early to avoid the wait otherwise it's definitely not worth waiting more than 30 min.

I ordered Signature Pork Soup Dumplings and Pork & Veggie Wontons in Spicy Peanut Sauce, both came out in less than 5 minutes. Yes, I had both all to myself and it was filling! The pork in both were juicy and tender. For the soup dumplings, I appreciate that the soup inside wasn't steaming hot, just hot enough where you can blow, slurp, and bite without burning your entire mouth! The dumpling skin was thicker than I remember but it was still a little bite of heaven in each bite. I also loved the spicy peanut sauce for the wontons - not too creamy or overpowering.Notes: They definitely upgraded from their previous location. This one is bigger and fancier. The service seemed better than before. Servers were super nice and attentive, always refilling tea with a smile. My server also anticipated extra napkins without me asking. We came on a Sunday at 11am and was seated within minutes. We never felt rushed because 30 mins later there was a long line."

I liked the new location more than the food. The restaurant was in a ""soft opening mode"" during our most recent visit, but still charged full price. Food: OK (3 of 5). Dishes We Had:- Pan Fried Pork Buns (生煎包): Very greasy. - Shanghai Pan Fried Udon (上海粗炒麵): A small and greasy serving, but pretty good. The udon noodles here are slightly harder and chewier than usual.- Steamed Lucky Six Soup Dumplings (六品小籠包牌): the included colors were beige (regular pork soup dumplings), beige with a little sprinkle / crown of ginger (crab meat / pork), orange (pork and scallop), yellow (chicken), dark grey (truffle), and green (squash).- Nan Xiang Soup Dumplings (南翔小籠包): regular pork soup dumplingsThe soup dumplings were only OK. Aside from the truffle soup dumpling, MSG seemed to unpleasantly influence the flavors of the various soup dumplings, emphasizing sharpness over depth of flavor. The worst for me was the chicken soup dumpling, where the MSG served to sharpen a raw chicken flavor. The crab meat / pork soup dumpling had little crab flavor. The restaurant serves soup dumplings without a bamboo steamer lid -- which means the dumplings should be eaten quickly, because the open air dries and cools the dumpling skins, and leaves the dumplings more susceptible to breakage. I'd like to see the restaurant include a bamboo steamer lid with the soup dumplings, so people may comfortably eat at their own pace.Service and Atmosphere: Very Good (4 of 5). Service was very good. Our food was brought out in a timely manner. Tea is complimentary, and staff constantly refilled our tea cups. The new space is lovely, especially the lobby, and the seating is comfortable. Nan Xiang offers free VPN-friendly Wi-Fi. There are two well-maintained unisex bathrooms with ADA grab bars, and an additional sink for handwashing directly outside the restroom area.Other:Nan Xiang Xiao Long Bao is an extremely popular destination, so wait times may be long during peak periods. The restaurant's dining area is on the 2nd floor. During our visit, the ADA chair elevator in the restaurant lobby (the 39th Avenue entrance) wasn't functional yet, but there is an elevator outside and behind the restaurant, in the Fulton Square common area (Prince Street, between 39th and Roosevelt Avenues). However, someone in your party will still need to visit the lobby to obtain a queue ticket."

However, I had decided to try their Lucky Six Xiao Long Bao because I had never seen flavors (and colors!) like these anywhere else. And WOW was it amazing. The initial reason as to why it caught my eye was because of the Truffle Soup Dumpling. I am a sucker for anything Truffle, so I was EXCITED to try these. After finishing all the dumplings, I'm shocked to admit that my favorite were actually the Chinese Squash & the Foie Gras Dumplings! The Truffle was delicious, but honestly didn't feel like it naturally blended/worked well with Xiao Long Bao in general. I was a big fan of the way the Squash was blended in and worked with the flavor of the XLB by adding a nice light sweet touch onto the dish. And the filling of the Foie Gras was also fun & delicious in its own way. Either way, the SAMPLER IS A MUST TRY!I'm shocked to add on that the Scallion Pancakes are also the BEST I've had. The sauce along with it went GREAT, and isn't the typical sauce I'd get with the dish. If I'm being honest, the sauce tastes as if it's nothing but Hoisin Sauce, but it was still a great dip for the best Scallion Pancakes regardless!My table also ordered the Pan Fried noodles with Beef, and the Handmade Steamed Dumplings. Nothing was too special and stuck out about these, but they were delicious nonetheless."

We stopped by NaN Xiang on Black Friday night, and the line was super long. We waited, though, since we wanted to check out the new place. 45 minutes later, we got seated. The dining area on the second floor is spacious with the dumpling gallery in the middle. They have new items like Lucky 6 Soup Dumplings which come in 6 different flavors; pork, pork and crab meat, scallops, chicken, Chinese squash and black truffles -- definitely a must-try. We also got an order of pork and crab meat soup dumplings along with spicy bamboo shoots and wood ear mushrooms AKA black fungus. It's amazing how something sounds so disgusting would taste so good!There are 3 issues I noticed during this visit though: 1. Wheelchair elevator in the front is not working. Instead, you have to take an elevator in the back. 2. Queueing system is not being utilized. 3. They claim their credit card processor is not working, so it's cash only for now!"

The best XLB I've ever had. I've been on the hunt for authentic, mind blowing xlb lately, and this has to be the best I've tried. The wait does get pretty insane, we were a party of 3 and we waited for over an hour. However, ITS WORTH THE WAIT! The service really makes up for it. The waiters were so nice and friendly, constantly asking us if we needed more tea and reminding us that our order will be ready shortly. The XLB - we each had an order of the pork xlb. It came out hot and steamy. The skin was so thin and had a great texture. It was slightly chewy but nothing overwhelmingly distracting. The pork stuffing was very generous- every bite had a huge chunk of meat. The soup, omg, the soup was so creamy. Usually xlb soup is on the clear side, but the soup that oozed out was a creamy broth. It made the experience that much better. Everything melts in your mouth, and compliments each other so perfectly. Only $24 for all of us, such a fantastic deal and amazing dinning ambiance. Everyone must come to this place!!! Hands down the BEST."

They have pretty much the same menu as before, except for the addition of several new soup dumpling flavors:  signature flavor (pork), crab and pork, chinese squash, chicken, black truffle, and foie gras (which is seasonal and limited).You can order the (F5) Steamed Lucky Six Soup dumplings (6), which is one dumpling of all 6 flavors.  All the dumplings had a nice generous amount of soup inside so be careful when eating.  The new dumplings are all different colors.  Quite pretty.  Instagram food pic!Green one.  Chinese squash dumpling had a taste I wasn't particularly fond of.  It was ok at best. Yellow one.  Chicken soup dumpling.  Also ok.  As far as flavor, I'd prefer the signature pork soup dumpling.Orange one.  This is supposed to be the foie gras dumpling, but it is seasonal and limited.  So instead this was a seafood pork soup dumpling.  There was a whole small bay scallop mixed within the pork filling.  This was good.  A nice sweet/ savory seafood flavor to the soup inside.  But I would have preferred to try out the foie gras dumpling.Saving the best for last!  The black truffle one.  It had a nice rich mushroom/ truffle flavor.  So good.  Must eat more of this!  Get it!Don't want to forget to mention the signature pork dumpling.  The white dumpling.  It is good. Pork and crab soup dumpling.  A white dumpling with a spot of yellow on the tip.   it's ok.  Could use more crabmeat in the filling.  A few other restaurants add more crab for texture and flavor.  Not a favorite here.  On to a few other dishes on their menu:A pan fried noodle dish.  Good flavor.  Portion was small.  A bit too oily.Pan fried pork buns.  The small amount of meat filling was a bit bland.  Dough was slightly under-cooked making it have a bit of sticky mouth feel.  Pan fried bottoms: a few were barely fried, the others were overly fried dark brown.  Too oily on the bottom.  Maybe they need a napkin on the serving plate to soak it up, or use less oil.Service:  Great.  Very efficient.  Very helpful.  Lots of staff everywhere.  Tea is constantly refilled.Decor.  Love the decor.  The first floor lobby is very beautiful with artificial handcrafted trees.  And there is a beautiful mini waterfall out front.  A walk up the stairs brings you into the dining room.  A beautiful new modern asian decor.  Antique designed chairs have their name etched in them.  The back of the dining room has some nice comfy booths. Nan Xiang is still in it's soft opening.  Open from 10am-10pm for its soft opening.Getting a table:   Walk up/ or get in line to get to the podium.  Get a number from the attendant.  On weekends the large waiting area will be jam packed with people.  Expect to wait at least 45 minutes at popular hours.Final note:  Some dishes were great.  Others were just ok.  Not worth a really long wait for a table."

This new, much larger and modern location with a larger menu, however, did spark my curiosity and made me give it a try. Our party of three had to wait around 30 minutes on a Friday night, which was to be expected. We ordered two orders of the XLB (typical pork & a new pork/chinese squash one), beef noodle soup, and the shanghai udon noodles. We enjoyed them all and I was actually very impressed with their beef noodle soup! I wasn't expecting much, but my friend said she always ordered it from here. I can see why. It's worth a visit!"

We came around 5:30 pm on a weekend and waited for 15 minutes. You just have to get your ticket number from the hostess and wait at the seating area which is pretty spacious. For 2 of us, we ordered:-Nan Xiang Soup Dumplings (6p) which is their signature pork soup dumplings. -Pan Fried Dumplings (6p) -Braised Beef Noodle Soup (not pictured) Soup dumplings were delicious! It's nicely made--it doesn't come apart like other places. I'll definitely order more of these next time! I would skip pan fried dumplings; it was good, but no surprises there. Braised beef noodle soup was amazing! Perfectly seasoned and full of flavor! Overall, it was worth that hour trip and I'm already ready to go back. Don't forget to bring cash--they do have an atm inside too."

The renovation definitely makes it seem more high-end but I question if it is being overly hyped up. Since they have reopened, everyone has been rushing to eat here so there may be a long wait. However, for a party of 5, I only had to wait about half an hour for dinner on Saturday night. The staff takes down your name and phone number, then hands you a piece of paper with a number. Usually, I love places that use the system of taking down phone numbers to inform you that a table is ready but they didn't use it at all. If they called your number and you were not there, they would proceed to the next number. They did go back and recall out numbers that were missed. I waited inside the lobby area so when they called out my number, I was there but I never received a text prior.The decor may be nice but the set up isn't that much nicer. The tables and seats were pretty crammed next to each other. I sat at a booth and the table was so close to the seats that it was hard to slide in. The staff was also quite busy so if you need anything, you really have to get their attention. The food also came out pretty quick after ordering and came hot to the table.One of my favorite cold appetizers is the spicy beef and tripe, which really isn't very spicy. It has great flavor and they definitely nailed it. The scallion pancake with beef is one of my favorite warm appetizers and it was very flakey and had a thin slice of beef. The soup dumplings is the highlight of the meal, of course. I tried the lucky 6, a new addition to their menu, which are the colorful soup dumplings that is being posted everywhere. It had a regular pork soup dumpling, crabmeat and pork, scallop and pork, chicken, truffle and pork, & squash and pork. Each one definitely had some flavor stand out based on what it was made of. They also all had lots of soup inside. However, I feel like the skin was pretty thick on these dumplings.Overall, the wait really wasn't very long and if you come with a party of 2, it is likely that you will be seated much quicker. Food was still of good quality and taste. I recommend coming for sure! & Plus, the different flavors of soup dumplings are fun to try."

They're back again with a more modern look~ IG enthusiasts, foodies, and hipsters would flock here...by the way restaurant accepts only cash.I like the aesthetically pleasing tableware, the small spoon for the ginger/vinegar sauce was not as practical as the old metal spoons they used to use.  In addition to modern decor, more items were added to the menu.  Pork XLB (6 dumplings): Decent, though I feel it does not taste exactly the same versus the past, the skin did not rip apart (good), and soup had satisfactory flavor---wished there was more soup.  I remembered the old dumplings gushed out soup that filled 3/4 of the typical Chinese soup spoons.  Now it seems more like 1/4 the volume.  Yes, I'm the type of person that would pierce my dumpling and pour the soup onto the spoon in order to enjoy a gulp of flavor.Scallion pancake with beef: Delicious but had less/thinner sliced beef from what I've remembered, extra hoisin sauce with the fried crisp pancake satisfies my soul.Pan fried noodle with shredded chicken: An ok dish, but pales in comparison to the other itemsOnly thing lacking when I visited was service, it was a bit chaotic.  When seated, we were not given any tea while other later seated parties did.  Had to request twice just to get tea, and they only pour the tea instead of providing a kettle (4 sips from the cup and you would need to hail a wait staff to refill).  It was hard to get wait staff attention at times.  It seems as if the wait staff walked where ever, there wasn't a specific person assigned to certain tables or area.  Also witnessed one female customer being dumbfounded when a waiter ignored her twice.Usually when ordering XLB, vinegar with ginger slices are served with it.  The older location shifted from serving saucers with vinegar and ginger already poured in to saucers with only sliced ginger with vinegar at the table to pour yourself.  But with this location we didn't get any ginger at all!  We and other customers had to ask the waiter for the ginger slices.It would be helpful to leave a note on the door near the elevator side of the building to indicate to go to the opposite end of the restaurant to be seated.  Upon entering me and a few other parties did not know about this and waited by the door until a server informed us.I'm not gonna lie I do miss the simplicity of the older location, it gave a more simple vibe.  Overall I would still visit here (decent XLB and scallion pancakes calls out to my soul), next time I'll venture out and try the colorful XLBs.  I'm hoping service will improve to match the restaurant environment."

Very crispy and awesome umami flavor.Seems like there is always a wait. But went pretty quick on a Sunday at 300. Waited about 15 minutes. Apparently this is now a bigger place than it used to be. They do have a lot of tables and food comes out quick but I didnt feel rushed. Wait service was very nice too. We both got the soup dumpling variety plate with 6 different dumplings. I wasnt crazy about the crab and truffle one. The truffle one just surprised me because that truffle oil flavor I am used to in Italian food not asian food where the flavor comes more from the mushrooms. It was just an odd combination for a soup dumpling. I liked the chicken, vege and scallop ones the best. Also the complementary tea they serve is great too. I had like 5 refills. Great place to go when your out and about in flushing!"

Did a little research before deciding where I wanted to get XLB. Everywhere and everything was pointing to Nan Xiang and I was super convinced that this is the place to check out. We already had Joe's Shanghai on our last NY visit so opted for new place to try. Came on a Saturday night at around 7:30-ish and already a full house waiting to get seated. Luckily, we were able to put our name down for a wait list and come right back since our hotel was nearby. The wait area, not much of a waiting area. Only a few seats available and anywhere you stand, you're guaranteed to be standing in someone's way. Our wait was estimated to be a 35 minute wait for a party of 2 but it went by quicker than expected and felt like we only waited 15 minutes. The dining experience is upstairs which has expanded from their old location as I have read. Almost thought this new location wasn't going to be open in time for us to give it a try. We were able to experience two types of XLB: pork and crab meat. Between the two, I preferred the pork XLB better but nothing about it wowed me. The crab meat had a lingering taste that I did not enjoy like it was too fishy. The outer exterior skin is actually a lot thicker than what I am used to. I'm not much of a vinegar person but something about NY vinegar just made me like a bit more. It was an A-OK meal. Seems to be overrated IMO."

The hostess calls the numbers really quick so if you are not there, you might lose your spot in line. We ordered a variety of soup dumplings, noodles and appetizers to share. I love their spicy beef and tripe and beef with scallion pancake. I also reccomend the noodle with shredded beef and pepper. However, their soup dumplings were underwhelming. There is something off about the recipe they use for the xiao long bao skins because it was a tad too thick and chewy. For some reason, their truffle xiao long baos are EXPLOSIVE so be very careful when you bite into them. It exploded for 2 of my friends LOL. Overall, I was not impressed with their xiao long baos. I do like the creativity of the Lucky 6 xiao long bao (scallop, chicken, truffle, pork, crab, and squash) in terms of flavor but I cant get over the texture of the dumpling skin."

I don't come to Flushing often but so glad I came here. Pretty good sized restaurant although my party of 2 still had to wait a short while but only 20 minutes or so on a Saturday night. Ordered a ton of food, including of course the soup dumplings and they did not disappoint. Better than most I've had in Chinatown. All of the other food was pretty tasty as well, got a tofu dish, udon lo mein (which was really good), and a few others. Even though I ordered way too much for 2 people, the bill was also just over $40!! Extremely affordable, good food, and really satisfying soup dumplings!

I would always rave about how great their food is, and how much I absolutely love their very basic dish: noodles with scallion sauce. Today was the first time I came to their newest location, and I'm afraid to say they've missed their mark on that dish for me. It was missing flavor, and probably a touch of salt when they fried their scallion, because I couldn't taste that same great taste that made me always want to come back for more. Also it was literally one of their cheapest noodle dish for $4.25, and now it's $2 more, which I'm willing to pay for, if they can get the flavor back. I'm aware that some of their chefs all went to another restaurant in Flushing, but I was disappointed this dish wasn't consistent to what I've always remembered it to taste. Outside of that, we got their chicken soup, which had ginseng, goji berries, chicken and a starchy potato that I can only name in Chinese. It was very flavorful and reminded me of the soup my mom would make us. We also got their special XLB with the 6 different pieces. Honestly, the only one I liked was the green one, which was their Chinese Squash XLB. The truffle was way too overpowering, and I couldn't eat it. Next time I will just order the XLB with only the Chinese squash. Their scallion pancake with pork slice is always good, as well as their pan fried pork bun. I actually prefer the pan fried one to the steam bun ones. Overall, I give this place a 4/5. I took a star off for service because they definitely need more servers. It took about 10 minutes to get our change back, and when asked about it they had to ask about 3 other people in order to get to the bottom of the situation. Also it took us quite some time to get our soup, which was one of the first items we ordered."

But with months of waiting, my friends and I successfully caught their soft opening at the brand new location, which is just down half a block from the original location. They have a number ticket system for waiting since they don't take reservations, except, we were able to get a number for our large group of 13 people via phone. We were in transit to the restaurant about 1 hour before when we attempted to make a reservation. When we arrived, we waited for about 25 mins which isn't too bad. That's a pro-tip for large group - Call them ahead of time to get a number so you are already on the list. You may still end up waiting for some time but at least you are ahead of the game (Disclaimer: Rules may change after soft opening).The seating area reminded me of Din Tai Fung, a popular Taiwanese dim sum chain in Asia and California. The soup dumpling makers stood behind an open glass window cubicle where everyone can see them. This was pretty cool. We ordered 12 rounds of xiao long bao because they were the highlight of the meal. I particularly enjoyed the chicken flavor (F3) because it was different and the broth in the dumpling was so hearty. They actually ran out of that flavor after we ordered 2 sets. Different flavor had a different color bun so it's safe for those who are allergic to crab (shellfish). Other appetizers worth ordering: cucumber salad with garlic sauce (C4), spicy beef and tripe (C1), and pan fried pork buns (B1 - warning: this takes a long time to make so order it right away). Next time, I will be coming early to try out the breakfast menu."

I've had other ""world famous"" soup dumplings at a few other restaurants, but nothing compares to the soup dumplings here. The truffle are my favorite but they are all delicious. I love the flavor of the soup and the meat/filling. My other favorite here is the Pork and vegetable wontons in spicy peanut sauce. I can't get enough of it. The peanut sauce is just perfect without being too overwhelming and taking over the whole dish. The soup dumplings and wontons in peanut sauce are definitely must-try's. I also got the jellyfish with turnip cold side dish and the cucumber salad with garlic sauce. Both are very light and refreshing which compliments the carb-y stars of the show (dumplings and wontons). The Michelin guide title of this restuarant is well deserved."

I was quoted a 40 mins wait for a table of 2, which I didn't mind since I had errands to run. I was given a number and by the time I came back, the hostess said only 2 tables were ahead of us. Within 5 mins of waiting, our table was ready. We were led upstairs. The decor and ambience definitely improved from it's old location. Much cleaner and modern looking. What we ordered? Lucky 6 dumplings- definitely very appealing, ig worthy and colorful. In terms of flavor, perhaps the black truffle was my favorite. Everything else tasted the same to me.Pork and vegetable wontons in spicy peanut sauce- this was actually very good. The wontons were very plump and meaty. The sauce wasn't spicy at all. Good thing they had chili oil on the side.Salted soy milk- i loved this! Mixed with pickled veggies, anchovies, fried dough... I could eat 2 bowls of this! I only wished I had the fried dough to dunk in it instead but they said they ran out for the day. Crab meat and pork soup dumplings- can't go wrong with this.The only thing that I would say that's different is that the texture of the dumpling skin was rather thick. I did notice that the dumpling was filled with lots of broth so maybe they had to make the skin thicker to hold the liquid? I personally prefer the dimpling skin to be thinner. The food also took awhile to come out and they forgot about our last order of the crab meat and pork dumplings. It was not until we asked about it and then it finally came.  I also didn't like that the tables were so close to each other as I could hear other peoples conversations and vice versa."

There is also a sampler, where you get 6 diff fillings (original, crab, black truffle, gourd, chicken (mine had wasabi in it), and fois gras (limited ed). The fillings all tasted good; the original tasted ""cleaner/fresher"" if that makes any sense; BUT the skin was a tad bit thicker (maybe its due to the new chefs wrapping it in the showcase). The scallion pancake and the shanghai udon noodles tasted exactly the same. I was told its the same chef from the OG place. yay!The service... A+. This is where things changed LOL maybe its the small break the waitstaff received or more pay, but danggggg everyone was so chipper and happy! all i saw were smile and heard laughter lol it was kind of different from what i was used to hahah these ppl were happy to be there and it shows!im happy NanXiang is back.

Shiny new space, friendly attentive waiters, and the same delicious food but in a better setting. My husband and I wanted to check out the grand opening soft launch on a Friday night at 6:30. We waited about an hour for a table of two. Luckily there is ample waiting space after you get your ticket with a number. you'll have to wait there as they won't text you. Don't be an amateur- check out the menu as you wait and figure out your order.Once we got seated at a spacious booth for four, we ordered immediately. Black agaric mushrooms, beef tendons, sliced pig ears for a few cold starters. All flavored well and not salty! Then of course, the very instagrammable Lucky Six: truffle, chicken, foie gras (fattened duck liver), crab meat, squash, regular. All had pork in it and were good, but not better than the regular soup dumplings! We would however go back for six of the truffle ones. The others were good, plenty of the same yummy broth in each dumpling, but the flavors could have been pronounced.We also got the oh so perfect scallion pancake with beef and crunchy noodles with pork. The sweet manager looked worried and asked if we were ordering for two?? When she saw that we finished, she said she was very impressed lmao!Overall worth the wait and immensely glad the food is on par with the old location, and that prices didn't shoot up either. (At the old nan xiang, the staff weren't mean, but they weren't nice. And we always felt rushed to pay when we were still finishing.

( less then 200 feets from old closed location).  It's a soft opening and their menu increased to more varieties of Xiao long Bao ( soup dumplings). It is still very good by Flushing nyc standards. I felt they trying go toward the Din Tai Fung level now but almost as good. The skin on the Bao was ok not as thin as Din tai fung but bigger and more filling. Service was good but long wait as expected.   Xiao long Bao is worth 4 stars but had a drunken wine chicken to go and it was super dry and chewy. Definitely not prepare right. I had to take a star away for their poor preparation of this chicken.The chicken is going to trash.No credit card yet in soft opening See photos and click helpful

We visited their previous location just up the block when they were still running the business out of a modest, run down shack. They're classy now - the newly renovated restaurant is spacious and much more luxurious . Their interior vaguely reminds me of Din Tai Fung in California as you can observe the employees making soup dumplings in an open kitchen on the second floor. There was a ridiculous line when we arrived and we waited for close to an hour for a party of 2. It was well worth it though. We ordered 2 appetizers including the spicy pig ears and jelly fish which funnily tasted better when combined as opposed to separately. We also ordered three orders of soup dumplings: 2 of the pork and crab and 1 of the lucky 6 which includes, you guessed it, 6 different varieties of soup dumpling flavors. I believe the flavors are on rotation (?) and the ones we ordered included: chicken, squash, truffle pork, crab, and foie Gras. Each was tasty and unique in its own way, and I enjoyed all of the ones I tried.Each order came with 6 dumplings and my oh my they were possibly some of the best I've had in NYC. I thought the taste and quality rivaled that of Joes Shanghai although honestly in terms of value I think Joes Shanghai still has them beat.The service is the reason I docked one star - we received our food pretty quickly however the water refill was spotty and I gave up on our waiter when they failed to deliver on water refills after our meal already ended."

Nan Xiang is in their soft opening phase and the menu has a decent selection of XLB, noodles, hot and cold appetizers. We ordered jellyfish, scallion pancake with beef slices, sticky rice shumai, and pan fried steam buns for appetizers and 4 baskets - truffle, chicken soup, pork, and lucky 6.The jellyfish and turnip cold dish was heavier on the turnip than jellyfish and had a taste I couldn't quite pinpoint.The scallion pancake with beef slices was one of the better dishes we tried. The pancake was crisp and not heavy or oily with a tangy hoison sauce in and on the side.The sticky rice shumai were savory and soy saucy and very similar to the rice wrapped in lotus leaves you'd find at dim sum. The pan fried steam buns were fluffy and the bun wasn't too thick with a good bun to pork ratio.Now onto the xiao long bao -- they were just okay. They were good, but pretty average. The soup was plentiful and the meat savory. Unfortunately, the flavors weren't distinctive enough from each other except the chicken soup dumplings which were lighter and slightly gingery in taste."

Called and made a reservations a few days in advance. Glad we did because there were a lot of people waiting when we got there around 12:30 on a Sunday. It's a large restaurant with lots of natural light. Very clean. We tried 4 types of soup dumplings: pork, pork and crab, squash, and truffle. They were all excellent - the pork was lean but juicy, perfectly prepared. The pork and crab had a strong crab flavor - much better than pork and crab soup dumplings I've had elsewhere. The squash was great, with shrimp and pork in it, and very unique, served in green wrappings. The truffle were my lea at favorite, but I don't really like truffle flavor. We also had pan fried pork buns which were perfectly prepared and juicy, great steamed vegetable dumplings, chive pancake, scallion pancake with beef - the best I've ever ha, fresh tasting and flaky, crispy noodles with vegetables, cucumber, and tofu with mushrooms. Can't wait to go back and try more!!"

I have not been to Nan Xiang since the last location across the street closed down.Well this new location is much cleaner, it's very nice with an upstairs dining room and a bigger downstairs waiting area. All waitstaff is equipped with an iPad for taking orders and all the food came out in a timely fashion.I ordered the variety xiao long bao since I wanted to try some new flavors. I had the scallop, the chicken and the veggie. My favorite was the chicken one. The soup in all of them was pretty good. We also shared the scallion beef pancake sandwiches which were perfectly crispy and flavorful and not soggy at all like other places.We also shared the crispy noodle with seafood which was pretty good. All the seafood was cooked very well maybe just a tad bit oily for my taste but everyone else were happy.I was also happy since I checked in and they gave me a small rat for the chinese new year that you could stick on your window. It was very cute! I will be back! Happy Lunar New Year!"

When we got there the line was huge so you'll probably always be waiting a little for a table but they are fast so don't worry. The dining room was large with booths as well as shared seating.My dad and I ordered the pork and crab steamed dumplings. They were delicious! We also ordered the cucumber salad which was perfectly fresh, crunchy and had so much flavor to it.We ordered the noodles which were I think the best noodles I have ever tasted and I've had a lot of noodles in my life haha. You have to order these! Everything about them was fantastic. Lastly we ordered the pancake with beef and it was ok. I would definitely not order this again but it was still good just not as amazing as the other dishes we ordered."

Coming from Texas there isnt too much of an opportunity to try soup dumplings since they are only carried at particular places. It seems there is an abundance out in New York though especially out in queens, I stumbled in on a rainy afternoon midday for a snack. And per the reviews this place has been around for awhile, they even have some awards for the last 5 years by that famous Michelin man. So this is the place to be for soup dumplings! I went on a Tuesday afternoon so it wasn't too packed yet, I do forewarn you though if you are spending less then $30 to bring cash. This was a mistake that I made after ordering the variety of different colored soup dumplings came to realize. The colors I believe of the soup dumplings are nothing but mere show to indicate what type of stuffing is inside. My favorite had to be the original pork and most of the other meat offerings or vegetable offerings tasted the same to me. I was so pleased with service and the soup dumplings we went back on Saturday the following week with  my family. Be sure if you are going on Saturday to show up early if your party is larger then 6. It's about an hour wait but well worth it!"

Upon arrival, you get a number a wait. Wait time for 2 on Saturday night during the Lunar New Year celebration was only about 15-20 mins. Once we were seated and placed our order, in just minutes we were served our first dish and the rest to follow. All dishes came out timed perfectly, so that nothing got cold. The serving staff was also very pleasant and helpful. For our meal, we ordered:Crab Meat & Pork Soup Dumplings (6)Lucky Six Soup Dumplings (6)Pan Fried Crispy Noodle w.

I've experienced better. 1. Crab pork dumpling: crab was very lacking.  It was a small dot of crab on the pork filling.  Didn't really taste much crab.  The pork filling itself was lacking in flavor. Shanghai Yu Garden makes this much better. 2. Beef tripe: Chewy and dry. Lacking sauce and flavor. Zero3. Red oil bamboo: I always had this dish here and it was really good.  This time in the new location it was dry and red oil had no taste. Not spicy. Zero4. Scallion pancake: deep fried, that itself gets a zero. Should have been griddled on light oil.  It was so unpleasant to eat.  so oily.   5. Chive Pocket: also deep fried like empanada. Oily oily oily.  zero.6. salty soy sauce: it's not salty and very lacking. ZeroI do not recommend this place.  Not going again."

I seriously thought I was never going to find a place like this again. So you can imagine my surprise when I found out that the restaurant didn't close and only moved down the block. Whew.. thank god!The new restaurant is ten times better than it's predecessor. It's bigger, cleaner, and wayyy more spacious. The interior and decorations are mind-blowing. Literally a scene(ry) out of an ancient Chinese drama. The food is also way more delicious than I remembered. The Signature Pork Soup Dumplings and the Pan Fried Dumplings are moist and juicy and the meat juices just ooze out of the dumplings at the very first bite.

Some of my favorites are Soy milk with crispy dough (light crispy kind, not the non-crispy super doughy choking you to death kind), scallion pancake with sliced beef, crab meat/pork soup dumplings, crispy shredded turnip (sold out the last 2 times I was there for lunch), fried rice cakes, noodles with scallion sauce. Even after the location upgrade, the prices are still relatively affordable comparing to new restaurants in flushing.  There's a huge improvement to the prior location in turns of decor, seating comfort, cleanliness and customer service. Expect a wait during peak hours - 3 of us waited 40 mins on a Sunday around 12pm."

We visited with my parents who loved the original restaurant. First the restaurant is much classier than the last place. It is nicely decorated with lots of light from the large windows. The servers are no longer surly ladies with a pad and pen but friendly people with an iPad taking your order. The price has gone up but the food is still excellent. The Xiao Long Bao is just as tasty now as it was then. The meat is flavorful and the soup overflows if you try to pour it out on the spoon. The other dishes are just as good. The scallion pancakes are big and crispy. The salty soybean milk is still authentic. The sweet soy milk is subtly sweet. Overall the quality is still good and I am grateful for that.

These new digs with its open kitchen providing a glimpse of soup dumplings coming to life resembles a Din Tai Fung, a far cry from the humble beginnings of Nan Xiang.The seating process was pretty straightforward, with a quoted time depending on the party size. The 30 minute wait for a party of two was pretty much on the money, and since a menu was provided during our wait we were ready to order as soon as we were seated.Starting with the soup dumplings, the flavor was pretty good but the dough was a bit too thick. Anyone who has soup dumplings before knows there is a risk of spillage due to the thinness of the dumpling skin - a thick skin minimizes such accidents, but at the ultimate expense of the dumpling skin. While the crab meat and pork dumplings were great, I would not recommend the Chinese squash dumpling on the account of both taste and texture. As for other dishes, I quite enjoyed the pan fried pork buns, beef tendon in chili oil, and pan fried crispy noodle with seafood. I should also note that service was a bit frantic, which probably lead to a couple dishes not making their way to our table without pointing it out to a server. I would chalk it up to growing pains after the move to this new location, so hopefully these issues sort themselves out after a few weeks."

This is a restaurant, not a stand, but they also don't serve any hot meat or vegetable dishes. However, there are several cold meat dishes - and they're great.Our party of four had a tasty meal on New Year's Day 2020. Cold dishes: beef tendon in chili, poached chicken, cucumbers in garlic sauce. Hot dishes: xiao long bao, pork with snow cabbage noodle soup, 3-meat fried nian gao. Service was very nice. We all agreed that all the food was delicious. The xiao bao not so hot they burn your mouth but heated enough to be flavorful, and full of tasty soup. Nian gao and noodle soup were also awesome. We loved the flavorful noodle soup broth! But interestingly enough, my personal favorites were the cucumber salad and beef tendon. A plus: the bathrooms were nice and clean. Plus 2: The space is nicely decoratedA little challenge: Dining room is on the second floor. But there is a personal elevator that can be put into service for a diner who needs it. A big challenge: by the time we arrived at 5pm, along with the rest of Queens, the wait for a table was 40 minutes long. Note to self: next NYD go early!This place serves Shanghai breakfast too, which is a rare find in NYC. I look forward to an early-in-the-day visit to give it a try."

I remembered enjoying Nan Xiang Xiao Long Bao a few years ago, and figured it'd be a good place to grab a quick solo lunch. I was surprised to find a long wait when I showed up just before 3:00. I'd apparently stumbled on its grand reopening in a new location after a closure of several months. I ended up waiting about a half hour for a seat, but I was happy to get my soup dumpling fix.The place was big and attractive, a considerable upgrade from the old location, which I think was much smaller and homier. The restaurant was slammed, but I thought the crowd was well managed, and I found the staff very nice and welcoming. Service was fast, but not at all brusque. My only gripe is that the restaurant was cash only, with no ATM on the premises. I had enough luggage that I didn't feel like rolling to a bank, so I made do with the $20 I had in my wallet.This limited my options somewhat, but thankfully $20 was enough to cover two orders of dumplings with a 20% tip. I got all soup dumplings, one order each of the pork and the pork and crab. (I wanted to try the sheng jian bao, but there was like a half-hour wait for them anyway. Next time.) Both were delicious. The soup was piping hot, but I managed not to scald myself, and it went down beautifully. The meat was juicy, and the dumpling skins were great, on the thicker side, up to the task of containing all that melty pork.It'll probably be another few years before I make it back to Flushing, but when I do, I'd like to revisit Nan Xiang with more money in my pocket and maybe a friend or two to help me take down more of the menu. I'd recommend it if you're craving dumplings. The place is fun and bustling, and the xiao long bao are delicious."

First, our hearts broke because we thought it was closed.....until we looked down the street and noticed the new location. It was about 2pm on a saturday, we put our name down (for 2) and were told an hour and a half to 2 hours so we went to some other shops nearby to kill time. We came back after about an hour and our number had already been called, so just a warning to everyone, those times could be well above what they turn out to be. The hostess was kind enough to still seat us! The seating area was nice and open, with big windows and lots of room. You can also watch the chefs prepare the dumplings which was a great touch. We ordered about 5 or 6 dishes and they came out staggered. We of course tried to wait for all of the dishes so we could get a beautiful picture for yelp...this was a challenge and I dont suggest it at a dim sum place. The bottomless tea was greatThe cold cucumber salad was delicious, the scallion pancake with beef was mouthwatering, wasnt a huge fan of the shanghai shumai but thats just personal taste, the dumplings were delish. But one sad thing happened on this day....our soup dumplings NEVER came. Turns out an alarm in the kitchen went off and they had to hold off on cooking. I will say this, the alarm went off in the restaurant and NO ONE got up, would you get up for an alarm after waiting almost 2 hours for a table?? Our waiter was so kind to bring us more cold salads while we waited to see if they could cook, but it never happened. We did get to try the tofu cold salad and it was DELISH. Why one less star? My tea. I ended up getting hair in my tea cup, not my hair and definitely not from the tea leaves. And sometimes our waiter disappeared for awhile which slowed down our ordering. That being said, I'm ready to go back and finally get to try the soup dumplings."

Sat through the pain... And the rest? Well, that's history!After coming across the multicolored XLBs on my friends' social media... I couldn't help but to get my friend and myself some of these too! Out of the six, I knew I had to go for the black truffle, as I am a sucker for truffle myself :-) (and no regrets!)East Coast to West Coast Tip:As someone who's moved to the west coast recently, and has only had DIN TAI FUNG all the freaking time, sorry Din Tai Fung but please move out of the way! You can't compare this place to DTF especially price and quality-wise! Yes, the XLBs are larger but there's definitely more soup in Nan Xiang's than DTF. That already beats it. Plus, the portion to price ratio is awesome.Ambience: The new location definitely speaks for itself! It's wonderfully rebuilt and the location is only half a block away from the old restaurant! Well, that's convenient. The restaurant isn't too loud and is perfect for family or friends get-together for a simple dinner. Luckily my friend and I didn't have to wait so that was a great start to our dinner.Food: Firstly, it is amazing. We started with the scallion pancakes (as it has been our go-to since a long time ago) and it's something I cannot have elsewhere. The beef is so soft and the crispiness from the pancakes compliments it so well. Then the sauce... Yup, no words. The braised beef noodle soup is so perfect for cold weather!! The only issue I had with it is that the noodles felt like it's been sitting there for too long.. a little too soft for my taste. The soup may be bland to many, but it was perfect for me -- warm and hearty! And then the XLBs... From the Lucky Six multicolored, the black truffle was my favourite! Since I shared with my friend I can only speak from the black truffle, green squash, and the chicken. The squash one you cannot really taste the veggie until the end, and the chicken just tastes like a normal pork xlb. The black truffle is just amazing... I can have one whole plate for myself, ty. Good quality food, and fair price. Definitely worth it!Service: Since it's busy, the servers are always up and running around. However there's always someone coming around to refill your cup of tea, which is the best thing for me. I dearly missed you Nan Xiang, and now I'm back! Aaaand... I will be back... You already know it. Until next time I come back from California :-)"

They closed down the old shop and set up a newly renovated restaurant a block down on the corner of Prince street.What to say ? Hmm.. here goes:Service and decor- a lot of fancier and the service is more efficient ( they still have the 3 ladies rolling up out the soup dumplings with a window to view). Food came out fast and there were no issues with wrong food being being served to the wrong table (the old restaurant had That issue in my experience)Food quality - the restaurant is pretty much known for their soup dumpling so why else would you go there is you're not having that .. their noodles are good asWell as some of their hot and cold appetizers ( see my posted pic). Compared to the old restaurant, didn't see negative change in food quality so that is good news as I have been in other restaurants where they renovated and moved,  but the food quality went downhill afterwards.price - well as you know, restaurant renovations don't come cheap so the new restaurant will be is a little more expensive than what we previously  had paid in their old restaurant. I would say that the Menu price went up roughly a dollar or so on average. Wait time - we came in on a weekend around 11:45 AM and it was packed due to the restaurant's popularity with the locals and with the tourist. From when we got our number to be call to when we actually got seated, the wait time was roughly a solid 45 minutes. Overall, I would give this place a solid 4/5 stars. Only reason why 4 stars is there I actually had a better XLB elsewhere .. Shissh... suppose to be a secret .."

I had done research the past few days and since I was in the area, we decided to give it a go -- I'm pretty glad I did!We were shopping at the Skyview Center and saw it was just a block away, so we went for it! Upon walking in, it looked pretty busy and we grabbed a number, table for 2! I'm guessing other parties were a bit larger, as we only waited about 10-15 mins. The service goes by pretty quickly.Here's my review on the food:Signature pork XLB: you can't go wrong with the classic XLB, however if you're a seafood person (like me), just go for the crab & pork XLB!Crab & pork XLB: YAAASSS. Juicy & tender crab and pork filling, drizzle a little soy sauce & chili oil over the top... *droooooling*Shanghai pan fried udon: I was a little skeptical as the description says ""shredded pork"" but they just mean thin sliced pork. We gave it a try as it was on the picture side of the menu, and I was so glad we did! This was def a 10/10 for me. The noodle weren't super soft but I didn't mind the texture! I really enjoyed the bok choy & pork with the flavor and seasoning of the noodles.Chicken herbal soup: your typical chicken soup, looks really fresh and the flavor was good! It was a good side dish to finish our dinner.Cold sweet soy milk: it was nothing special about their soy milk, tasted like all the other soy milk drinks I've tried at other asian restaurants. Still good though!Wonton tossed in chili oil & peanut sauce: a big NO for me. My boyfriend ordered it and when it came, it wreaked of peanut. He then realized we overlooked the description saying it had peanut in it. We're not allergic, but I'm not a big fan of peanut in my savory foods. I made a comment to the waiter that we didn't like it (my boyfriend tried just one) in hopes they might take it away and off our bill, but nope.. no biggie though, it was our fault for not reading carefully. Lucky 6 dumplings: Ehhhh.. I'd pass on ordering this again. I guess it's okay to order if it's your first time for the pictures but overall, I wasn't a big fan of the tastes. I'll stick to my crab dumplings. Love the color of the skins though.Overall, we spent $75 including tip. We definitely over ordered but I brought the remaining dumplings I didn't finish and had it as a late night snack! I would definitely come again but keep my ordering to a minimum."

When I came here recently, it was worth every minute spent riding the 7 train across town. Make sure to get there a bit earlier than you plan to eat so you can put your name down and then maybe grab milk tea or something nearby. The dish they're most known for, Xiao Long Bao, is done better here than anywhere else I can find in NYC. Don't let this trick you into ordering only XLB though, as many of their other dishes are also delicious. Their husband and wife special and pan friend noodles were both absolutely delicious as well."

We were queued to wait and seated within 20 min. The six color XLB is beautiful and a great way to sample all the types they had. i preferred their crab meat + pork dumpling over the signature pork-only dumpling. Squash was yummy too.their crispy bottom bao could've been crispier on the bottom but the meat was flavorful and not tough. occasionally service was spotty (forgetting to serve water) but otherwise they were quick. cash only still lolplenty of seating! will definitely have to come back. reminds me of a less sterile din tai fung haha

The ambience is casual and family-friendly. I ordered the jelly fish salad, lucky six soup dumplings (Signature + Crab Meat & Pork + Black Truffle + Chinese Squash + Scallop) and the original soup dumplings. There were a lot of soup broth inside the dumplings, and the broth was very flavorful. The only downside about this place is the service. Since they are famous and so crowded, it took me a while to be able to order the food, and the waitress totally forgot about bringing out the jelly fish salad if I didn't remind her several times. I highly recommend trying the soup dumplings here but make sure you come before 10 am. When I left the restaurant, there was a long line waiting outside even in the cold."

The new spot is ten times better now, they accept credit cards which is nice. More tables and seats, more staff, larger kitchen, they get you in and out and have a good flow.  The wait wasn't bad at all.  Service was stellar and on point, took the baby with us and they were very helpful and had high chairs.  Food was amazing, we over ordered but didn't regret it at all.  Got every kind of dumplings (pork, crab and pork, assorted) and our go to dishes, beef tendon in spicy oil, scallion pancakes with sliced beef, beef fried udon noodles.Our drinks were filled at least 8 times by the end of our meal. They came by and kept the table spectacularly clean, even with our kid making a mess.  Food was amazing, again; stuffed to the point I could not move and still wanted more."

What can I say? I was a tad bit worried when I stepped in. Have been a patron of the original place for over a decade, I was hoping that this place wasn't just Nan Xiang in name only. The decor is completely different. Gives off a Din Tai Fung feel mixed with your typical newer Chinese restaurant that's trying very hard to remind you that you're in a Chinese restaurant with all the Asian decorations and design. The service has stepped a lot since the old place. Even though we got in right before they were set to close shop, they sat us down and served us. The service quick and not pushy. (Side note: it was nice to see some of the original servers working in the new place. I didn't know them personally nor did I have any attachments to them but I did feel bad when the old shop closed and people lost their jobs. So yea it was nice to see that they're back.)Now for the food! First of all the tea was served in the perfect temperature. Not boiling hot and not room temp or cold. Just perfect. We ordered some of our usuals from the old spot: Cucumber Salad with Garlic Sauce, Noodles with Beef and Shredded Pepper (dried), Braised Beef Noodle Soup, and of course a stack of the Pork Soup Dumplings. The Cucumber and Braised Beef Noodles were just like I remembered if not better. They included 5-6 giant chunks of beef with my order and I was actually done with the noodles before I finished the beef. Fantastic!The Noodles with Beef and Shredded Pepper now includes scallions and scallion oil like the Scallion Noodles. My wife loved the upgrade! Another win!Now finally, the soup dumplings. The skin (dough) is thicker than I remember. It isn't as tender as it used to be but it actually held together a lot better than the older version. (I remember breaking 3 out of 6 dumplings back then no matter how careful I was and it always made me sad.) The thicker skin held the soup inside the dumplings better but I did enjoy eating the older version better. It's not a total fail nor is it a win for me on this point. It was kind of a trade off. The flavor is still there but not quite as rich as it was before either. Overall I really enjoyed our meal tonight. I am happy that Nan Xiang has made a glorious return to Flushing and I hope they keep up the good work in the future. This is a 4.5 star review from me and I look forward to returning again and again until I am a ripe old man."

As a Shanghainese family, there's a lot of comfort in eating the food that we were so familiar with, and the taste and price were both excellent. It was sad to hear that they had closed, so when we heard that they were reopening, we knew we had to stop by.The trip itself started off rather strangely. We walked in through the back door, which had no sign indicating that it was the back door. At first we were quite surprised that it seemed pretty empty but then walked to the front of the restaurant and realized that there was a huge number of people waiting. We got our number and was told 20-30 minutes (this is on a Sunday afternoon around 3 PM). Since we were already here, we figured we'd just wait since it didn't sound like a terrible wait. We ended up waiting exactly 30 minutes for our table to open up.The whole experience felt very rushed. We were given dirty chopsticks and tea that was lukewarm. The waitress, who was in quite a hurry, even spilled some of the tea as she was serving us. For the three of us, we ended up ordering five dishes.1) Spicy Bamboo Shoots: 3/5 - The flavor was okay, but I do love bamboo. Overall, I think the flavor seemed only okay since it wasn't salty enough.2) Scallion Pancakes with Sliced Beef: 5/5 - Probably my favorite dish that we ordered. The scallion pancakes were perfectly crispy and the sauce to dip it in was a nice touch.3) Rice Cakes with Preserved Cabbage and Pork: 2/5 - This used to be one of my favorite dishes at Nan Xiang. However, again, it was not salty enough and the rice cakes were a little on the softer side than I remembered them to be. I felt like they were much chewier in the past.4) Shanghai Siu Mai: 2/5 - The sticky rice in the siu mai had very little flavor. The skin was also a bit too soft, in my opinion (almost a little soggy). 5) Pork Soup Dumplings: 3/5 - The soup dumplings were good but far from being the best that I've had, either at Nan Xiang themselves or at another restaurant. The skin was way too thick for my taste. Saltiness and flavor-wise, though, this was fine.We also tried to get the Salted Soy Milk but they said they ran out. Also, it said their credit card machine was broken ( unsure if it's always broken or just happened to be broken today ). With all the other options in the Flushing area, probably won't be returning."

So take this all with a grain of salt, since they did just move locations and likely hired a lot of new staff. The new location is super nice, the interior looks kind of like of knock-off Din Tai Fung. They even have the clear window where you can watch the dumplings being made, just like DTF. We came on a Saturday at around 1pm and were told the wait was 30 minutes for a table. The lobby was full of people also waiting  for a table. About 40 minutes later, we were seated and promptly ordered the pork Xiao Long Bao. We tried to order the turnip puffs, but unfortunately they ran out right before we ordered, which we were super bummed about. The XLB came in around 15 minutes, fairly quickly, and looked absolutely beautiful. The ginger that they served with them was super fresh and thinly sliced. It was all set up for success. However, upon consumption, the XLB tasted pretty average to me. They were definitely good, but not deserving of the unbelievable hype I'd heard about this place - everyone told me this was the best XLB in Flushing! Also, the vinegar they provide was weirdly sweet and made for a discomfiting eating experience. Really not a fan of sweet vinegar.After we finished eating, we asked for the check multiple times, and it ended up taking ten minutes to get it due to a seeming lack of coordination. There also seemed to be a lot of people hovering around the waiter station with nothing to do? The place honestly seems overstaffed. However, everyone we interacted with was super nice, and I'm sure that the check issue will be a nonissue further down the line. This place was good, but I feel like I maybe missed its best days when it was a smaller shop. Personally, I preferred the XLB at You Garden."

Asked for water. Brought 1 cup.  Were the four of us supposed to share it?  Asked for more cups. Silly. Asked for more water and tea twice. No one just came by to pour at our table. Diet Coke never came either. Asked 3 times. It was on the check though. Lol. They took the charge off. Waited longer for our to go noodles than the time it took for us to eat our dinner in. Cannot complain about the food though. The soup dumplings are still the best in the city. And the scallion  pancake with beef is heavenly. It's my 14th time here and of course we will be back.

The new place is bigger and it's not even a block away from the old location, you can't miss it, its right at the corner. It has two floors, one for waiting and the second one for dining. They renovated the place and upgraded. It's so much nice and cleaner. Servers are much nicer too, seems like they got rid of the rude servers from the old location. The food is still the same tasty and cheap. Soup dumplings are my favorite, they're different than other Chinese restaurants. The scallion pancake, fish cake dish, pan fried noodles are my to go always. The only thing is whenever I go, they don't serve the hot sweet soy milk :(. Overall is a nice atmosphere and the wait is 30-40 mins on the weekends night, regular days there's no wait."

My assumption is that the brand was sold to new business owners, and the old staff was lost. They're really milking their Michelin recommended status from 2009-2017. But I guess there's a reason it was lost in 2018/2019. The soup dumplings are no longer thin and moist with tasty soup - they are thick, dry, tough/chewy and the soup is basically bland. I had to load it with vinegar soy to add the flavor. The crispy noodles were not crispy. They were drenched with sauce and super salty. Decor/aesthetics improved significantly, but the quality decreased significantly as well. I was quoted a 30 minute wait and waited 55 minutes to get seated! Not worth the wait. Overall disappointing as I was actually really excited for their return."

I'll let the pics I took do the talking but the soup in those things - not only are they plentiful and bountiful but they're so flavorful as well. Wow, I was seriously impressed. This might very well be the very best XLB I've had in my life. The Lucky Six that we got was fantastic and allowed us to get a sample of the various flavors they had. The black truffle one has to be my favorite. All the of the items we got were really good actually. We went at 9:30am and there was already a wait of 5 min. By 11am when we left there were hordes of people already waiting. You can tell this place is busy every day and it's easy to see why.

Ever since I saw the late Anthony Bourdain smash on some on TV. I made a point that I shall try them out and ever since, I am addicted.Which brings us to this place. After shopping around at the Skyview Center Mall. The hubby and I worked up a pretty darn good appetite. We saw a few spots slinging these yummy delicacy, but for some reason, this guy wins.Let's do the food shall we.Beef Tripe:     A bit on the spicier side. These light meaty pieces can definitely destroy a small city. It's that good.White Wine Chicken:     I love this stuff... only thing missing is the liquor and fizzy water. Definitely worth ordering.Fried Udon:     Since the restaurant didn't have any rice for some odd reason. We ended up ordering these guys. Perfect chewy texture on the noodles and the flavors were totally amazing. Definitely a yes if you're looking for carbs to add to the spread.Pork Xiao Long Bao:     These are my new favorite thing in the world. Be careful when eating these because the soup comes out like hot lava. Then dip them in the sauce for a life changing experience.Crab Xiao Long Bao:     Its super interesting. The flavors are super poppy and my hubby favors these over the other. I love the seafoody finish.The restaurant is a typical no none sense spot. You come in, you get seated. Wave at a server and bark your order.I totally enjoyed my dining experience here. Also, dont forget that this is a cash only joint. Also,, their big sign isn't in english.

The line/wait can get ridiculous on the weekends but their soup dumplings are one the best I've ever had. This place is called Nan Xiang XLB for a reason. They have pork and crab soup dumplings and both are fantastic. They also offer a bunch of other dishes. I recommend the pan fried udon or the scallion pancake. I'm also a pretty big fan of their cold appetizers. I personally enjoy the spicy tripe and their bean curd. Both are highly recommended.Make sure you order the XLB first. It's made fresh and takes awhile to make it to your table.Service: 4/5I've never had a bad experience here. The service gets a little slow when the place gets packed but that's understandable. The staff members are usually very attentive and accommodating.Ambiance: 3.5/5This place was renovated upon expansion. The place is pretty plain and the tables are awfully close together. Their XLBs make it worth it though.

Back when they were at their original location, we visited many times and enjoyed the service and quality of the food each time. The soup dumplings are always a hit as they were juicy and filled with delicious scalding broth. Make sure you eat it with care and pair it with some sweet black vinegar. My favorite appetizers are the Wood ear fungus and pickled cucumbers. Both dishes are fresh and vibrant. They definitely prepare your palette for the heavier savory dishes. Do try any of their noodle soups. The Braised beef and pork chop noodle soups are well portioned and perfectly balanced in terms of chew, slurp, tender meat and broth. Though we didn't order it this time, the scallion pancakes and stir fried udon are always a hit with us. On top of everything, they were gracious with my wheelchair bound grandmother and provided adequate wheelchair accessible seating right away.The elevator takes you to the back entrance so if you need seats, make sure you go through the main entrance on the first floor.

They were quite efficient, well, maybe too efficient... Within a few minutes of us sitting down, they came and asked if we are ready to order. Wow! And, the food came out SUPER fast! We had Steamed Pork Buns, Scallion Pancake, and Cucumber & Garlic. I really liked the pork buns, which was more like soup dumplings. Scallion pancake was very fresh with nice crispy-ness to it. Simple flavor that was very comforting. Cucumber & Garlic was super refreshing, and gave a nice balance between more meaty and oily dishes. We added one more dish, Pan Fried Dumplings. They were nice fat babies, had real weight too it! They were super meaty and juicy, almost as juicy as soup dumpling. The portion is generous and we were very full. The staffs were not overly friendly, but again, very efficient. They kept the complimentary hot tea refills coming, without us asking for it. The food was very tasty, and very affordable too.

For free items: tea 0/5 (PLEASE CHANGE TEA SUPPLY), Chili paste on the table 5/5.I wanted order salty black rice roll (咸紫米饭团) from the menu, but they didnt have it, they also didnt have all kinds of noodles, otherwise I wanted try their scallion oil dry noodles (葱油拌面). I really like their iced soy milk, it is the best one I ve had so far. I like their chili paste but there is no dish on the menu is a good match with it... I hope I can steal some then go to buy a pork and egg steamed rice roll (广东早餐肉蛋肠粉)to eat with it. I am not a soup dumpling fan, they have crab meat and row in the dumpling but I just dont think the taste is good, I like their soup dumpling skin though, I also had soup dumpling from another famous Shanghai restaurant ""Shanghai You Garden"" in Flushing, theirs are worse, I dont get it why I can taste out strong white pepper inside. I asked my BF, he think the crab row soup dumplings we had here are pretty good. I doubt and asked again, he said Cant I have my own opinon, I think they were ok but it was not worthy for the wait. (We only waited 20 minutes, that is nothing for me.) Ok for soup dumplings, My comment is ...There are a thousand Hamlets in a thousand people's eyes!Be careful their beef stickers, especially you are expecting the beef stickers from Nanjing (七家湾牛肉锅贴). their beef stickers skins were not cooked done, I bite and saw the raw dough layer. ahhhhh. anyway, it is a good place you can have many different dishes with small portion for breakfast or lunch if you like Shanghai food style, their menu is simple so it is friendly to Non-Chinese, no dish is hard to understand."

What awesome XLB in all different flavors! Perfectly juicy contents and larger than your typical soup dumplings. On our most recent visit, we had party of 9 on a bustling Friday night. Waited about 40 minutes to be seated. The wait staff were efficient, responsive and professional. The restaurant interior was clean and well maintained. We loved the Nan Xiang Soup Buns, the Crab & Pork Soup Buns and the Lucky Six (photo)! The handmade pork/cabbage dumplings were as pretty as they were delicious (photo). Our group kept adding additional orders of the scallion pancake with beef... although I thought it was a bit greasy. Next, the puff pastries were simply heavenly -- red bean puff and turnip ham puffs were made by expert hands!  These particular dishes were my favorites -- any one of these would be enough to bring me back! We had several other dishes that were also very well crafted and very tasty... Overall a great foodie experience!"

Anyways - this place is one of my favorite xiao long bao places. I've been going to them since I was in high school (I'm in college now!!) and they've kept their consistency with quality. I always enjoy coming here because their service is fast and the people are always polite. Since I have a large family, we ordered a few dishes (see below). Try it out for yourself!!"

Of course you still need to order the xiao long bao here. If you come here and don't order them you're doing yourself a disservice lol. The dumplings are good if you like less fatty soup and thinner skin. It also only comes with 6 i believe vs 8 at joe's shanghai. For me, these dumplings are not filling i need like 2 orders by myself honestly. We also ordered jellyfish, fried bun with chives, rice cake with shredded pork and shanghai noodles. The jellyfish was fine, nothing special but nothing bad to say, comes with turnip/white radish? The fried bun with chives my bf's cousin ordered. This was interesting had cut up noodles in it and i love chives but it didn't wow me. On the other hand i enjoyed the rice cake and noodles, but i also ordered this knowing i generally like these types of dishes. Loved the rice cake, not too mushy and tasted great with the pork. The noodles were good (like udon) but oily affff by the time we got to the end of the plate which i'm used to but can be kinda gross for some people. Overall still yums but i think people hype it up a lot."

I don't really believe in 5 stars, but I really do think this place is special. Everything that we ordered was SO GOOD. The Pan Fried Pork Buns were the perfect start to the day and the Chinese pancake w Sliced Beef made me weak! That being said, we also ran out of stomach space before we hit the REAL flushing Chinatown- I'm sure that there are older restaurants/hole in the walls that could make Xiao Long Bao as good, if not better, for a cheaper price.

Although this was a soft opening they sort of skim on the beef Crispy Seafood Noodle - Crunchy chewy and goodCrab Xiao Long Bao - The dumpling skin is more tainted orange. But overall a good soup dumpling.Lucky 6 XLB - I would say great for photo but overly hype. Only would prefer eating the truffle, crab, and pork. The squash one didn't make the taste or texture any different. The worst one was the foie gras. Apparently I'm not sure if it's on purpose but I had a heavy blow of wasabi flavor. I couldn't even recognize what I was eating. Although it's limited but try on your own risk.Overall I pretty much enjoy the new location for the deco!

As delicate as the soup dumplings are, none of them broke during the delivery process (special thanks to the delivery person)! I also ordered some pan-fried pork buns and they taste amazing because of the crispy bottom. Despite needing the food to be delivered, the food still tastes authentic and it makes me crave soup dumplings again.

Leaves the mouth slightly burning though!Other appetizers I've gotten are the scallion pancakes with beef. So. Delicious. I also get a dish of noodles and my usual go to dishes are Shang Hai pan fried noodles and seafood udon noodles! The seafood udon noodles usually come off a bit too oily for me so I'm always hesitant with ordering this dish.Everything is relatively cheap and affordable for the amount of food I've ordered. The restaurant is also has a lot of tables but when it gets to prime time, the restaurant gets packed! The wait is never toooo long for me though even if there is a wait, it's usually pretty quick and they take your order as soon as you're ready. Therefore, the service is great!

The food is still tasty, a basic set of breakfast/lunch/snack standards that will be familiar to anyone who's been to Shanghai.Unfortunately, the current setup for food pickup is inefficient and unsafe. Let's start with the physical aspects. The food is being delivered from behind a screen at the top of a staircase. The staircase is not wide enough for two people going up and down to stand six feet apart. At the bottom if the stairs, there's enough room for two or three people to stand safely apart from each other.This wouldn't be such a problem if the food were being prepared efficiently for prescheduled pickups. The restaurant's website does allow for scheduling at 15-minute intervals. However, both times we've come the food has been significantly delayed. This means more time standing around in an increasingly crowded space with potential disease exposure.Making matters worse, the restaurant has a tablet where people can walk in and order - so they pick their dishes and then have to stand around for at least 15-20 minutes waiting for the food. The crowding is just unacceptable right now. You can easily have ten people in a space that's safe for half that number.For people who pre-order, it's not clear which orders are ready when you walk in. You have to weave your way past the other customers to the top of the stairs, find someone - it's not always easy - to check on your order, and then, if it's not ready, go back down the stairs again past the same people.The ordering system seems to have left the staff befuddled. Some people are picking up by number, others by name. The whole thing seems pretty random, and the communication from the staff is minimal.The last time I went, I waited 15-20 extra minutes for a pre-scheduled order. The woman who brought it to the table said it wasn't ready, so I kept waiting. Then a man came by 10 minutes later, and when I asked what was going on, he brought the woman over and asked her. She said the order actually was ready, so I left thinking that I'd waited an extra 10 minutes in that unsafe environment for no reason. But when I got home, presto, one of the items was missing.In the half hour that I spent at the restaurant late morning on a Saturday, only three orders were brought out. That's a pretty poor showing at a peak time of the week. We really want these folks to succeed, and we know it's not easy right now. But please, don't put your customers at risk."

And this was fortunately given to us when we came to Nan Xiang's.We arrived around noon time on a busy saturday.  It was a plus that the restaurant had municipal parking just across from it where we were able to park with no hassle. Other street park only allowed an hour of parking but this lot allowed 3. As soon as we entered the restaurant, there were no lines. And since we were only a pair, we got to sit right away. The area was divided into 3 and we were seated at the middle. It was a busy aisle but it also turned out perfect for us. We were close to the kitchen where we could see ""the making of the dumplings"" (handmade!) and we were close to the cashier for easy payment. The service that day was very good as well. We didnt have to call for water refills as they were pretty attentive, which was a bit of a surprise to me seeing as how the place got busy as soon as the clock hit 12.For the food, like other reviews said, they do come out quick and some only seconds! The baos came first. Boy were they very soupy! The dough held them perfectly and they were still piping hot! A few got ripped as I took them out of the containers only because I wasnt patient enough in taking them out carefully. We had both pork and crab xiao long baos. Although, im allergic to crab, i found that it was more tastier than the pork. We also ordered pan fried dumplings. They tasted amazing! I love how the dough was made. Still had a very good chew despite that it was fried. It was one of my favorites there. We also had the beef scallion pancake. They were good but was too greasy.Overall, we had a very good lunch there. I appreciated that the menu was not too extensive so picking out which food to get wasnt so confusing. Would definitely recommend the place and would like to be back whenever im by flushings."

As you walk into the shop, there are multiple awards from yelp and Micheline star posters plastered all over the cashier/waiting area. I personally think this isn't the best Shanghai spot as the soup dumplings were not my favorite. The skin on their dumplings were too thick and the soup is average. Seeing so much popularity from this place, I had higher expectations but sadly it has not met my standards. So if you do want to try great soup dumplings definitely check out Shanghai asian manor in Chinatown! P.S. this isn't an ad, it's just my honesty recommendation"

We ordered both the crab and pork ones. It came in portions of 6 so that was perfect to share between a group of 3. We only ate about 4 dumplings each in the end, and I felt I could eat more. I feel like I could have eaten at least 6-12 dumplings to be satisfied.We ate them without paying attention to which meat was which and in the end they tasted the same and none of us really could tell we were eating different things. My friend said the dumplings were small in comparison to others they had. As a first time xiao long bao tryer I thought they were good. The broth was nice and flavorful and you HAVE to pour in some of that sweetly sour vinegar sauce to eat with it (the flavors contrast so nicely). The skin of the dumpling itself was thick and chewy, I kind of expected it to be softer. The meat itself was ok, not as soft and tender as I thought it would be, but not bad. Overall good soup dumpling, makes me want more. This place was so hyped up but it didn't really meet the hype for me. Don't get me wrong they were really good soup dumplings, just nothing spectacular."

We also ordered a plate of Shanghai stir fried udon and stir fried nian gao. Food was alright. Not too bad. Everyone at my table commented that the drunken chicken needed more flavor. Appetizers had a decent amount of food although the Shanghai stir fried udon was demolished in a matter of seconds. Overall food could've used better flavor. The spicy dishes were not spicy at all and this is coming from someone that has a super low spice tolerance. Overall service was okay, food came after a decent amount of wait time. We ended up having to search for the pot of tea and pouring our own tea. The wait for a table was insane. They did a good job trying to speed up the process and having people look at the menu ahead of time, but the food was a little disappointing.

Ok so we waited about 10 minutes. Still no call. I went in again, she said, 5 more minutes, they are cleaning our table. Oh good Lord! At this point I was hungry on the verge of hangry. I kept my composure and go along with the flow. We got sat before this other customers who got sat like a minute after us, but for some reasons, she took in their orders before us!

I came with a vegetarian person, and they had a lot of options on the menu. We ended up getting scallion pancakes, veggie noodle soup, veggie dumplings, and a cucumber side dish. I also got the classic soup dumplings (because why not) and they were very delicious! We got tons of food for less than $25, which was way more than enough for 2 people. It was crazy!

We ordered 3 lucky six soup dumplings and 1 crabmeat soup dumpling, scallion beef pancake and beef tendon in chili sauce. The beef tendon was a cold appetizer and was very flavorful. Their scallion beef pancake was so crispy and cane with extra sauce on the side. Can't ever go wrong with this! The lucky six soup dumplings come with one of each: crabmeat, pork, chicken, truffle, scallop and chinese squash. Many come for the truffle and I'm a HUUGE fan of truffle in Italian/French dishes, BUT THIS AINT IT. I've tried truffle soup dumplings before and I stand by my opinion that the flavors DO NOT match! Steaming the truffle takes away the natural aroma and brings out too much of a regular mushroom flavor- which is fine, but not what I look for in truffle flavored dishes. Also, they use black sesame to make the skin black and you can actually taste it, which I didn't enjoy. On the other hand, the scallop and original crabmeat pork flavors stood out the most to me. Their crabmeat had so much crab and was so creamy and flavorful compared to most other places' crabmeat soup dumpling. The scallop was also really good because it had a sweet scallop taste to the regular pork. And yes, it comes with a small fresh scallop inside! We came all the way from Brooklyn just to try Nan Xiang and I'd come to Flushing just to order racks of their original crabmeat XLB!!"

I did enjoy the different flavors of the lucky 6 soup dumplings. My favorite was the crab meat! I recommend going for the crab meat dumplings over the pork. I wished the spoons for the dumplings were a tiny bit bigger. I also liked the udon, it wasn't anything crazy and probably be better with minced meat. The soy milk was also really good, I recommend trying it out here(really different from store bought). The service here was good, staff was very tentative. The interior of the restaurant was really beautiful especially with the window of the dumplings being created."

We were seated very quickly. This place is brand new and very clean, which makes us feel very comfortable. We ordered the signature pork soup dumpling, beef scallion pancake, Shanghai fried udon, and the pan fried pork dumpling. Everything is so good especially the pork soup dumpling. The skin is one of the thinnest that I have ever had. Would definitely recommend to try! The service was so quick and attentive. Everyone was nice. Can't wait to visit again!"

Omg the pan fried buns are so juicy and tender and when you bite into the buns it's a bit crispy. It's literally the best pan fried bun ever. Their soup dumpling is good but to be honest it taste just like any other soup dumplings.We also had their rice cake with veggies and pork that was a decent average dish. Their spicy tripe and beef was pretty good as well. The spicy level has a kick to it so I enjoy the dish as well. Don't forget their beef scallion pancake the pancake itself was flaky and crunchy with the beef in the center of was pretty darn good.So yes I'll come back for their pan fried buns.

I am forever grateful for you guys being open and delivering during these hard times. I ordered the braised beef noodle soup and, of course, the xiao long ago. If I could re-live my first bite of the soup dumpling over and over again, I would. Absolutely delicious. Craving satisfied."

Needless to say we definitely over ordered for two people. My sister raves about the truffle soup dumplings which was why I opted out of the colorful one, regret on my end because while I like truffle I don't love it as much as her and it was a bit too much for me. I did like the crab soup dumpling and would recommend that along with the beef noodle soup. The spicy beef tripe was really aromatic but lacked in spice for me, for some reason I feel as if it use to taste better when they were half a block away‍ I would recommend the soy milk but would have preferred to drink it out of a cup and have it cold instead of a bowl and hot. The pan fried beef dumplings were juicy but not amazing... they were just okay. I am just happy this place opened up again and I liked that there is a lot of seating and service was efficient, however I did remove one star because while I knew the lady handling the number downstairs has a hard job I didn't like the fact that she knowingly let people cut the line... if there's no reservations for this restaurant you shouldn't let people cut in line, this lady and this guys number were five numbers behind us and they had two people just like us but she let them go in first ..."

We waited an hour to sit 2 people so it must be good, right??? The pan fried noodles were so soupy that it wasnt even crunchy - would not recommended!! However the scallion pancakes were actually cooked well, and one of the best I've had in NYC! But everyone comes here for the soup dumplings which were honestly 6/10! We have had better. Some of the dumplings were already popped when we picked it up, so the soup would come out. I'm not sure if it's worth the wait to come here, but if there's no wait then go try it!"

If you arrive before 1pm and it's raining you're in luck! A table for four no wait. Little did i know that when I came back with a party of four and we waited 15 mins for our table. Saw that there were over 3000 reviews on yelp and I knew I had to try this place out. I had this back when I was in Shanghai and there was also a wait. So we ended up ordering takeout and ate it at the hotel. The pork steam dumplings in shanghai were small though. Alright back to this restaurant in NYC. All the items on the menu seem more breakfast type of food. What we ordered: Salted Soy Bean Curd: ($2.75) this tasted okay. Seem like they just threw it soy sauce on top of the soy bean curd. Scallion Pancake:($3.95) crunchy on the outside. Pan Fried Pork Buns: ($6.95) (6 pieces) order came out cold. Guess it's been sitting there for quite some time. Maybe we shouldn't have order this since we order dumplings. Rice cake with shredded pork and preserved mustard: ($7.95): basically what it states. Okay dish no wow factor to it. Shanghai Panfried Udon: ( $7.50) looked more like udon with beef and shanghai bak Choi. I like the Chinese style better with seafood. Steamed pork buns: ($6.50) not enough meat filling. Also we order crab too but when our order arrived, they messed up the order and gave us 2 pork dumplings instead of 1 pork and 1 crab. Not happy about that as they won't do an exchange for us.I don't know what the rave is about this restaurant but there are better soup dumpling restaurants out there. Service was mediocre. Food was okay. I had high expectations due to the amount of reviews but sadly disappointed."

After the worst 4 months of not having Nan Xiang, it's finally back.And what a comeback!First things, first -- Nan Xiang caved and delivered on some Insta-worthy soup dumplings!White: porkWhite with yellow (crab meat) on top: pork & crab meatGreen: Chinese squashYellow: ChickenPink: ScallopBlack: TruffleNote that you also have the option of just getting an order (6 pieces) of one type of dumpling.I've been coming here for years and it can do no wrong in my book, so just going to write everything that I love in my recommendations below.As for the long wait -- yeah, it's a little worse. At least before, if you saw people standing outside, you knew it was already packed. Now, it's super deceiving because there's so much room to wait inside that by the time you open that door and finally get a sense of how crowded it is, it's too late. You've already committed to dining there (just kidding, but you get the point).And they accept credit cards now! Time's are a-changing!Cailin's Recommendations- Breakfast: Scallion Pancake ($4.50): it's fluffy, but filling, so plan ahead -- like, don't order too much or else you won't enjoy it- Breakfast: Fried Fun with Chives and Egg ($4.95): it's delicious, but also filling, so plan ahead- Cold dish: Cucumber with Garlic Sauce ($6.95): I have yet to see another restaurant make this dish as well as Nan Xiang- Cold dish: Savory Pressed Tofu with Chinese Celery ($6.95): amazing amazing amazing- Noodles Soup: Pork & Cabbage Noodle Soup ($7.75): the amount of green in that soup is a STEAL- Fried Noodle: Shanghai Pan Fried Udon Noodle ($7.95): one of my favorites - it's not heavy on the sauce and it's so delish. The only thing it's missing is like more protein - it just has shredded pork- Fried Rice Cake: Rice Cake with Shredded Pork & Preserved Cabbage ($9.95): oh man, this is also a favorite of mine!- Soup Dumplings: I mean, the crab meat & pork ones ($8.25) are the best. The other ones are fun to take photos of (not the pork alone though, that one's boring in appearance and taste) so you can get the Lucky Six soup dumplings ($10.95 [for the Insta!]) and then you should another order of your choice (to satisfy your soup dumpling craving - one order is never enough!! It's like an addiction).Again, can't go wrong with this place.If you've read this far -- thanks! This is my 100th review! Whee!"

Grand opening this past week. The decor is modern. The wait is long. The food is bland. The service was terrible. We waited almost an hour for our 6 dishes. Our first dish was fast. The scallions pancake with beef came out cold. After that nothing. Who did we disrespect to get this terrible service. The soup buns is their bread and butter item. Everyone got their soup buns we had to wait. The old place was better food wise and service wise. To make up for their poor service they gave us an order of pickled cucumbers. I will give it another one more chance.

First, I was surprised about how big it was. You have to go upstairs for seating. It was incredibly busy, but the service was still great! Everybody spoke perfect English and was nice and checked in on me. Food was a little expensive, but definitely worth it! Some of the best pan fried pork dumplings I've ever had period. The food warmed me up a lot. The free hot tea was a nice touch too. Will be coming back soon! Thank you!"

Service was pretty good- I went to the old and new location. The new location has the different colored soup dumplings but honestly they all tasted the same. The truffle ones tasted really nasty too me and I just felt like it didn't mix well together. Overall we ordered a good amount bill came out to $71 for just 2 people. The only thing that was reallly good is the beef pancake everything else was nothing I would go back for."

Ordered two appetizer of pig eat and tendon; chewy and slightly spicy. Then the xiao long baos, a thin dough keeping in all the soupy goodness with a plump piece of meat inside. Ordered 4 sets of xiao long baos. 2 of the regular soup dumplings, 1 crab soup dumpling and 1 colorful variety of soup dumplings. I think I could eat these all day long. The things that brought it down was the dipping sauce. It had the usual soy sauce, ginger and vinegar but not enough vinegar and it was bit sweet. Maybe they are trying to cater to everyone, so less vinegar and adding sugar. The crowded long wait, maybe to be expected since it opened up not long ago. The bad positioning of their doors, they have two double doors and one isn't being used but people keep trying to open it even with a sign on it. probably since it's the door at the front of the restaurant. Lastly, why change a good thing. The last place was great and had its original charm. Other than those few things, it's still a good place to eat soup dumplings."

Never went to their old location but came here to the new location recently and I'm super regretting that I hadn't came and try their food before! Great soup dumplings!!! There are other food options too on their menu but if you come with some friends, just get a few trays of soup dumplings and you'll sure be satisfied enough already!"

The dining area is up a short flight of stairs and is more spacious, with a wonderful wood decor and name personalized utensils. Though they were busy, the staff were attentive and friendly. I ordered the Pan Fried Pork Dumplings (B2) and the Steamed Lucky Six Soup Dumplings (F5). The Pan Fried Pork Dumplings taste delicious, with a thin skin holding in all the juicy pork flavor. The skin was extra crispy, which isn't my favorite, but if you enjoy that crisp, this is a must.  The Steamed Lucky Six Soup Dumplings, according to the menu, consists of their Signature + Crab Meat & Pork + Black Truffle + Chinese Squash + Chicken + Foie Gras (Seasonal Limited) soup dumplings. The Signature is their regular one, which was good with all that soupy goodness. The Crab Meat & Pork had a very good seafood flavor, which overpowered the pork flavor. The Black Truffle had a good truffle flavor. Added that yummy mushroom-y flavor to the meat and skin. The Chinese Squash didn't really add to much to the flavor, and was nothing special. The Chicken had a lighter flavor than the regular Signature ones, and I did like this better than the Signature. I am pretty sure my last dumpling was not the Foie Gras. It had wasabi in it. I assume they probably didn't have the Foie Gras. It had a tad bit too much wasabi in my opinion, since that was all I tasted. Also, for some reason, they thought it was a good idea to put some at the top opening, so it hit my taste buds pretty hard when I took a bit. Overall, pretty good variety, and makes for a colorful picture!I am happy they have a nice new location, with the same delicious dumplings, in addition to the new flavors! I will definitely be back to try their other dishes!Update: Came again the next day with someone else! We ordered 2 orders of the Pan Fried Pork Dumplings (B2), Steamed Vegetable Dumplings (B7), Handmade Steamed Dumplings (B8), and Truffle Soup Dumplings (F6).The Pan Fried Pork Dumplings were just as good as the day before. We did get 1 of it first, and didn't get the 2nd order until we finished with our other dishes, but one of the staff was attentive enough to check up on the 2nd order for us (Shoutout to Alice!)The Steamed Vegetable Dumplings were a bit undercooked in my opinion, but were still tasty. Good lighter option.The Handmade Steamed Dumplings are smaller in size than the pan fried  dumplings, but they come with 8 instead of 6. Good bite sized portions with the same juicy inside.The Truffle Soup Dumplings were the star. The truffle taste is strong but not overpowering. Still cash only, but hopefully they start accepting credit card!"

For what it's worth, my brothers who are more into Chinese food than I am thought the cuisine was better than a typical Chinese restaurant.My brothers and I shared 2 orders of steamed vegetable dumplings, crispy dough, and a scallion pancake, and my brothers also ordered the udon noodles (substituted chicken for pork). The vegetable dumplings were warm, filled with various greens, and overall decent. The pancake was tasty but greasy and the crispy dough well tasted like fried dough (not my favorite taste). I liked the hot tea served (instead of water) with your meal.Prices are cheap (the above was around $35) and service is quick. Note: This restaurant can get crowded. I came on Christmas Day and waited 45 minutes for my party of 3."

I went recently during the weekend for lunch and it was like a zoo in there. They have a terrible system of having the party grabbing a ticket and waiting in the main room by the entrance. I feel bad for all the other guests who are sitting there cramped by all the people standing near the tables and waiting there as well.I ended up sitting in this room and as mentioned it was a winter day. As the door opened and closed numerous times my feet went numb as we sat there for about an hour.Do not get me wrong the food is awesome but they need to step up there system of having people seated during the winter.

A bigger, trendier space, with an emphasis on service. It has definitely lost that family restaurant feel. Unfortunately, the food hasn't improved. The side dishes of pig ears and cold dishes were decent. The pan fried noodles were pretty good too, but the soup dumplings were a let down compared to their competitors. The skins are too thick and their special xlb with different color and flavor dumps are just for insta show and lack any real depth in flavor to differentiate themselves. If you're looking for good xlb, go somewhere else. Otherwise, their other dishes are average."

You don't need to read my review to know that. There are over 3000 reviews here so you know the soup dumplings are good. Very very soupy. Definitely get while you're here. I STRONGLY recommend their scallion pancake with the beef. Probably one of the best thing I ate all day. That includes the soup dumplings!CASH ONLYI don't recommend the stir-fry udon dish. It was very greasy and wasn't that great. Don't get the udon. Come for the soup dumpling and the pancake. 5/5 stars. Udon 1 star.

Coming from someone who grew up eating at Nan Xiang, I can tell you it's not the same was it use to be. Flushing has so many newer, better, and cheaper Xiao long bao restaurants. Nan Xiang does not live up to the hype it use to. You're  better off waiting at the other Shanghainese restaurants that offer better deals for better food. Not to mention that there service is not the best."

If you DON'T want to wait upwards of 30 to 45 minutes, I'd suggest somewhere else. After the constant hype i hear about this place I finally made it here to wait about 40 minutes for a table for 2. We ordered their Nan Xiang Xiao Long Bao, and two noodle dishes. Honestly, the xiao long bao did not taste much different from other places I've had. Not to say that it wasn't good, but it just wasn't anything spectacular. Our noodle dishes were good as well, but again nothing I can't get somewhere else, and probably cheaper and better. If you've never gone and you're willing to wait it out, give it a try. Otherwise, I think this place can be skipped on my opinion."

I always come here to fulfill my Shanghainese cravings. I always get the steamed pork buns, Shanghai pan fried noodles, scallion pancake with pork or beef?, and the cucumber with garlic. Everything tasted on par. The pancake with the beef or pork was a little bit in the saltier side. The cucumber and garlic is always sooo yummy. Crunchy with a hint of pickled taste. I was surprised to see that they have covered their tables with table cloth to elude to a fancier dining experience. The staff and service was swift and polite. They only take cash here so remember to hit up an atm before coming in."

I've tried tons of soup dumplings and Nan Xiang easily has the best I've had in all of NYC. Definitely worth the trek out to Queens and will be coming back often. Might be a bit crowded during peak hours though!

Head to Nan Xiang Xiao Long Bao. They have some really good steamed buns, dumplings and noodles to fill your belly. They give tea here for free and the service is very friendly. I ordered the chicken soup dumpling as well as the veggie steam dumplings. It was really good, i couldn't have ask for a better din din. The soup was so hot and tasty, like I was slurping the juices of chicken heaven. The veggie dumplings were surprisingly really moist and tasted like meat, but wasn't. This place is a hidden gem in Flushing, Queens."

Wonton in hot oil peanut sauce is NOT spicy at all,barely taste the hot oil, mostly peanut sauce. The wonton skin is better than most restaurant.

The place is solid and has been so for a while until it became a coveted tourist destination. Now you'd expect a 30 minute or so wait time to get seated.That aside, the food is good. But not drastically different than the other XLB places I've been to in the area. Not a huge fan of their recent branding with the glorified XLB fillings. People I know order them once for the sake of trying them but are often disappointed and return to the original pork/crab fillings."

To me, that's what the smart money gets. It costs a little more, but luxury doesn't come free. Live a little. Treat yo self. Love yo self. The plain ain't no Thang. Basic.ok I'm out of cliches, but I say this because some ppl are unimpressed by the basic xlb here, but that in itself is because it's basic. I'm rarely impressed by any spots basic xlb. It's just a bigger plain dumpling. Boooring. There's no richness of the crab... what the Chinese call that xian flavor. A little lesson in the word xian. The character is made up of the combination of the char years for fish and lamb. Hence this is a flavor that is different and novel so to speak. So in a nutshell, the two flavors of meat and seafood together create another flavor. But I digress... Try it once and u  prob won't ever go back. Unless u got a shellfish allergy. Then I would advise against it.Other things here that are good include the rice cakes with pork and preserved veg. Also the noodle soup with fish and sour cabbage. Also the beef with peppers noodle soup. Always my go tos. The scallion pancake with beef isn't bad. But I mean, go big or go home. Why settle for basic things? Save your money and use some elbow grease at home. You can do it. I believe in you. Human potential is limitless. The new location doesn't feel the same tho. Weird setup. The wait is usually ridic too. Well seems that way based on all the ppl waiting. I never have dined in at the new location yet. Smart money goes strait up the stairs and orders to go from the counter. Fast and (quickly) furious... ly eating.... Before all the peasants in the waiting area even find a place to rest their tired, hungry legs to continue their anxious wait for a table. You'll love the look on them newb faces as u leave with food in hand. Yeeeeeeet!"

I was at the recent soft opening of this restaurant and I was not disappointed. I've been going to nan Xiang since it was at the old location across the street and the quality of the food has remained the same and as delicious as ever. The decor looks great. It's bigger, there's more seating. I waited at most 10 mins on line for a table for 2. While waiting on line, I noticed a lot more non-Chinese dining here in comparison to the old location. I assume the restaurant has gained a lot of popularity which is a good thing.  (Owner, if you are reading this, your prices better not skyrocket, for the sake of your loyal customers who've been with you since the beginning.

The rest tasted the same as the regular dumplings We waited for 45 minutes, and there's still a whole crowd of people waiting to eat and probably waiting for longer. Overall experience was mediocre, would have given three stars but dropped it down to one because of the missing dishes and mediocre food. Service was good though, and their pumpkin cake was great.

The service was like most Chinese restaurants - inattentive and curt - but we came here for the food. Dumplings: We ordered pork XLB, crab XLB, and Shanghai shiu mai. The XLB here are very soupy, and the soup itself is very meaty and flavorful. The pork in the pork XLB has a strong taste of ginger. The crab XLB has a strong crab flavor (almost suspiciously strong - hope it's from actual crab and not crab flavoring.) Chilled side dishes: chilled tripe was delicious and rich in spices. Only critique would be the numbing spice needs to be a lot stronger. Garlic cucumber was also great. We also ordered the beef wrapped in scallion pancake, Shanghai udon, spicy beef noodle soup, and soy milk. Everything was delicious and inexpensive.

We ordered the regular soup dumplings, pan fried crispy noodles with beef and scallion pancake with beef. The soup dumplings are just as good as I remembered! The scallion pancake was crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. The crispy noodle had a lot of sauce so it was really salty, probably won't get it again.

The wait was 30-45 min and the waiting area got really packed. We didn't see fast turnover. It's also odd that when they initially call your number, it's a standby call. So you wait again at the stairs until they call your number again to finally go upstairs. Service was fast and efficient. We got the crab and pork dumplings, beef and spicy pepper noodle soup, and the special 6 soup dumplings. All dishes were just okay. The crab and pork dumplings really didn't have crab in it. The special dumplings all tasted the same to the point that we forgot that they were even special. It's a great concept but they all kinda just tasted like pork dumplings. The skin of the soup dumplings here are also pretty thick compared to other places. The soup just tasted like carton beef broth that they threw in some peppers and beef. It did have a good peppery kick but without deep flavors to the broth and a bit to oily. They also mixed up our orders so we got the colorful dumplings first which were lukewarm. Then a while later they brought out the color dumplings again along with the crap and pork dumplings which were piping hot. So I guess we got someone's unwanted order of special dumplings? There's def better soup dumplings in nyc in our opinion."

Maybe I'll try again next time, but it won't be anytime soon. There are many other great restaurants with great customer service in that building complex and around the area.  I do hope that Lin gets proper training and learn about good customer service."

To be fair, the filling and soup did have good flavor, but the skin was very thick, almost 2x thicker than it should be. It was like eating a regular Bao zi, not a soup bun. The ginger slices for the vinegar were also too thick. The  other dishes were also very blend. The salted soy milk was watery and lacking/needed more crucial ingredients. Overall: the staff was much nicer than the old location; Decor is nice; value is ok, not great. I hope they can improve on their soup bun's skin thickness."

My advice is definitely get the soup dumplings. I have never had them and my husband raved about them. There is a reason for that, they were amazing. We had gotten Singapore noodles which was good as well. Everything we got was delicious and came out hot and in an appropriate time.

My family had been going to Nan Xiang for two decades (since it opened in the original spot); I still remember when it just opened. We loved the XLB, stir fried rice cakes, scallion pancakes and the tofu pudding. When it closed suddenly, my entire family was devastated. I went with my mom to try the new location about two weeks after it opened; we waited 35 minutes for a table and ordered our usual: the pork XLB, the 6-flavor XLB, rice cakes and the egg/chive pancakes. My mom noticed immediately that the XLB dough was thicker and less pliant, and I noticed the pork meat was not as silky as it used to be. The 6-flavor XLB was a marketing gimmick - we couldn't taste any difference in flavors except the scallop one had a tiny piece of scallop. Everything was bland and tasteless. The rice cakes were also tasteless - couldn't even tell it had been stir fried -- it could have been just been boiled and then tossed with edamame and mustard greens and some oil and that was it. We don't usually need to salt our food when we eat out, but we needed to add salt because it clearly hadn't been seasoned. The egg/chive pancakes were OK - thick pastry but not crispy; not that much filling. Service was terrible - our plate settings had chopsticks, but no spoons despite ordering the XLB; and it was impossible to track someone down for help and for water refills. Waiting for the check to come took nearly as long as our actual meal did. We will not be back; the wait is not worth it, and other good XLB places have opened in Flushing or elsewhere in Queens to fill the void."

Only dumplings i eat are in soups. But at this restaurant the soup is inside the dumplings. I was kind of skeptic if the dumplings would even taste good to try. Man oh Man oh Man took a bite from the top of the dumplings slurp the soup and flavors bursted into my mouth. Best dumplings I ever had hands down.

Last time, I also got the cucumbers which were light and a good break from all the heavy dim sum foods. We also got the beef noodle soup which was really good. The beef was very tender and fell apart easily."

My boss and I stopped by for a quick lunch while waiting to check in at the hotel nearby during our business trip. To my surprise, even at 2:30 pm there was a wait for a table. When you walk in, the restaurant is cozy but very energetic. You have the aunties wrapping the XLB in the corner of the restaurant where the streamers are and waitresses running around to take orders. We ordered the original xlb of course as well as the pan fried buns and two side dishes, bean curd and marinated seaweed. Original Xiao long bao:These surprisingly, were delicious! The soup within the bun was well seasoned and the meat filling was nice and soft. One thing that I didn't like however, was that the skin of the dumpling was a little too thick for my liking. Overall though, this is my favorite of them all. Pan fried buns:Nothing much to comment about here. The bun itself was also a little too thick and it wasn't as juicy as the others I've had in Cali. Flavor is good though and meat was soft like the soup dumplings.Side dishes:Just ok. The seaweed tasted like it was drenched in spicy sweet and sour sauce but overall, not bad. It's good for an appetizer as it was intended to be.Definitely recommended for the xlb but other than that? Well that judgement will have to wait until next time I come back :)"

The skin was thin yet chewy and the inside was not too salty, which is something I've noticed other places have trouble with!

Though I didn't mind that at all since my mind was fully occupied by how amazing the soup dumplings were. Quality is consistent every time. We liked all the dishes we ordered, such as regular dumplings, scallion pancake, soy milk, chicken soup, and marinated gluten. My favorite is still the soup dumpling (xiao long bao). I recommend spending a few more bucks for the kind with crab meat. I usually put a dumpling in a spoon and take a small bite to drink the soup first, then pour vinegar on top and slowly savor the rest. I still see people putting the whole thing in their mouth - the soup inside is really hot and will burn your mouth!

I got the soy bean milk (sweet), xiao long bao, scallion pancake. The soy bean milk was tasty! It wasn't as sweet as I anticipated it would be, it was a big bowl though! If you get it hot it would come in a bowl like soup and not a cup. The xiao long bao are very juicy, really like them while they are hot, once it cools. The scallion pancakes were very oily, they are also good when it is hot. Bottom line is for chinese food, I like mine hot because so much oil was used to cook it that I like to eat it hot.EnvironmentIt is a small restaurant front but the interiors is very big. It is New York, I can't except some Orlando style seating!

I vaguely remember the food was ok to good and the crowd was mostly Chinese. The rice cakes were chewy and perfectly sautéed with soy sauce.Last weekend we went with another couple and a friend. The crowd was a mix of Caucasians and Asians. We had the XLB (crab and pork- 2), Pan fried XLB or Sheng Jian Bao  or Pan Fried Pork Buns (1), Scallion pancakes with beef (2). We all feasted before coming, so we didn't order a lot for 5 people. XLB- this was good. Thin skinned, hearty hot soup inside. Good flavors.Sheng Jian Bao or Pan Fried Pork Buns- This was ok. The bun was fluffy with a good crust on the bottom. The soup was good but I wanted more of it. And 2 of the Pork buns had raw pork inside. Maybe this isn't a good representation of Sheng Jian Bao or I don't like the thicker dumpling wrapping. Scallion pancakes with Sliced Beef- the first batch was ok.

Did the chef spill the sugar bottle while cooking them?  MY GOD, the sweetness is ""next level""!   Believe me, this is not an extravagance, you can literally order them for your dessert.

Typically more fluffy and airy.(3) The sweetness and consistency was just right. Too often the milk is too thin and thus lacks flavor but theirs was rich and perfectly sweetened.(4) The skin was the perfect thickness to keep them from ripping, but not too thick so that the chewiness was balanced nicely. The meat and soup were very flavorful and not too greasy.* There are no teapots on the tables and the teacups are tiny.

We were a little disappointed, but since we were here for the soup dumplings, we were pretty okay.We wanted to try all the different types of soup dumplings, so we got the Lucky Six. We asked the waiter if we should get the Truffle, but he said that we should get the Crab instead. Trying the truffle in the sampler set, it was a very faint taste, so glad that we didn't miss much. The skin seemed a little thicker than it used to be, but still satisfying to eat. We rounded out our order with Spicy Beef & Tripe, Cucumber Salad with Garlic Sauce (which suddenly has carrot in it now), Scallion Pancake with Sliced Beef, Pork & Vegetable Wonton with Spicy Sauce, and Bing Dou Jiang. We also got chicken in wine sauce to go.

The hype is real, these are the best soup dumplings I've ever had! They're super ""soupy"", tender, thin skinned, delicately flavored little packages of goodness. When arriving, be mindful that the parking is very limited but there is a municipal parking lot directly across the street that was jam packed and many cars were stalking and circling desperately looking for spots. It took a good five minutes for me to get a spot. There are also parking garages in the vicinity but I'm not sure of the pricing. Back to the food... we started with ordering the fried bun with chive and egg which was sort of like a fried calzone stuffed with these tender scallion greens, chopped boiled eggs and these tiny little shrimp. The menu doesn't say it had shrimp as a listed ingredient so be weary if you have a shellfish allergy because that's exactly what happened and we were lucky to spot it before any real harm was done. The scallion pancake with beef was excellent, it was tender, crispy, soft beef slices with a bit of hoisin sauce. We ordered one portion of the Xiao long bao and after tasting it when it was cool enough, we immediately ordered two more portions. We also tried the stir fried udon which had good flavor from the hot wok, it was pretty good but a bit oily. Another thing worth mentioning is that their chili sauce is very good, not particularly spicy but a deep toasty flavor which compliments their food very well."

I like that they added a few more different flavors for the buns and also different colors. It's a nice display. The food is also delicious with a great price.

We dropped off some items to his friend then came to this place for dinner at 11 PM. When we arrived I was surprised because the place is packed and more people are still coming in. The only thing about this place is that they only accept cash like many other Chinese Restaurant. Anyway, let's get down to the food.We ordered pig's ear, bean curd tofu, regular flavor and crab flavor XLB, Sheng Jian boa, and Shanghainese sticky cake with fermented vegetable with pork. The flavor of the bean curd tofu and pig's ear were really good. The XLB is better than Ding Tai Fung in my opinion. The regular XLB is juicy and the flavor was good. The juice doesn't taste like pure fat and greasy but was flavorful and doesn't make you sick. The Crab flavor XLB is also good, you can taste the shellfish flavor rather than just blend. The sticky cake and Sheng Jian boa were also really good. We walked out happy and very full.Overall I would recommend this place since their food is good. I think I made the waitress feel awkward cause I thanked her for getting us the food, tea, and other stuff lol.... but yea food is good!"

Pan fried pork dumplings were soft inside and a little firm on the outside. Well seasoned with a tangy kick. The steamed pork dumplings had a thicker skin and were just as flavorful as the pan fried.  The scallion pancake sliced beef was my favorite!

Unfortunately as with Yelp fames it seems it might have gotten bit over hyped. My experience here few weeks ago overall is probably decent at most and would have been worse if it wasn't for their great Xiao Long Baos. Since its gotten quite popular it was about 10-15 min wait on a Sunday around noon for 2 people with a number system. The hostess is pretty diligent as she comes out to announce next party every few minutes or so and is always on the move bringing people to their table definitely a plus on reducing the waiting stress :)We ordered various items from their easy to read menu with pictures, another a plus for a high volume restaurant like Nan Xiang. Their XLBs are definitely the favorite among our choices but really there are so many competitions around the area and in Queens that I didn't feel they were a step above everyone else'sThe other menu items are pretty good but nothing too memorable unfortunately. The pork chops were crispy and fresh but probably a little too greasy. The scallion pancakes I thought were a bit too salty overall and probably can cut back on the sauce a bit more. The beef strips noodle soup had quite a good texture of noodles but probably overwhelmed with the spicy green peppers.The waiter service were decent although not very attentive given how busy the restaurant gets, there were couple of times we had to ask for extra utensils and bowls but they did their best to oblige. I am curious about their breakfast items and might return for it in the future. I guess if we show up early enough for breakfast it might just make the dining experience a bit more pleasant."

They do get quite busy during lunch and dinner time. We went as a party of 4 and waited around 40-50 mins during lunch time. However, when it was finally our turn, we got seated quickly and the food came out quickly. I believe they also got a lot more people working comparing to their old location, so the customer service got a lot better too. I usually get the scallion  pancake and the chives cake. They make them so crispy and flavorful. You tiao is also one of my favorites when you eat it hot. FYI, they only take cash."

Mostly, if the service/food is alright, I'd never leave review/comment or whatnot. However, this time, I have to leave a review about this restaurant. The outer layer of Xiaolong bao is dry and mushy. XiaoLong Bao is usually eating with the Chinese vinegar. And the vinegar is supposed to make it tastes better. However, the vinegar tastes way too sweet which makes it tastes gross. Not only that, the waitress, she didn't even give us shredded gingers. And I know that they recently just moved their store, redecorated and stuff. I don't understand why, for some reason,  the store still smells like paint to us.

But my absolute favorite dish, which was unexpected was the scallion pancake with sliced beef. The outside was crispy and the inside was airy and light with a delicious sauce from the beef.

Being Shanghainese myself, I have tried authentic soup dumplings all over the place. As per usual, I feel like this is one of those restaurants that are overhyped just to please tourists. To begin with, I got two orders of soup dumplings, udon with pork, soybean soup and scallion pancakes with beef. The meat inside the soup dumplings tasted inauthentic, as if it were put out for awhile. The skin of the dumplings were thick too, which isn't supposed to be. The stir fried udon with pork was okay, nothing too special. Soy sauce, udon, cabbage, and pork. We ordered the soybean soup thinking it was going to be cold, but it was hot. There was nothing wrong with it, the sweetness was just right, which was a plus. Lastly, the scallion pancake with beef came with only 3 pieces. I thought it'd be more. The pancakes were unevenly distributed, so the last piece didn't really wrap much around the beef. However, the sauce was delicious.The service was fast. The workers were nice. However, at the end, when we paid (it's CASH ONLY by the way), they forgot to give us change and thought we didn't pay!! There was a miscommunication between the workers and if they hadn't trust us, we would've paid double. There are definitely better soup dumplings out there that aren't flooded with tourists."

Usually a lot of people and sometimes you won't get a table a lot of the time unless you wait a lot time and no reservation allowed. CASH ONLY! Nice food and good textures! Quite authentic but always missing a taste for example the grated garlic for the drunken chicken or the minced garlic with 2-3 slice of red chilli pepper with the pig ear.

Lovely on a winter night.We also had the Shanghai Shao Mais, tasty sticky rice dumplings with no meat. The Xiao Lung Baos are first off large, about 2 inches in diameter and packing tons of flavor. 4 people ordered 3 orders each, 2 crab/pork, and another pork.

The xiaolongbao was very savory, but the skin was a little on the thick side. The scallion pancake with sliced beef was delicious, and the sweet bean paste on the inside was a surprise and added a good note of nostalgia for me. The rice cakes were good, although perhaps not as flavorful as they could have been and didn't have that much shredded pork. The pan fried pork buns killed me.

Albeit a popular spot, Nan Xiang knows how to keep quality high and service efficient. Great value for your money as the food here is really good for its price.I normally come here on weekend lunch and there's usually a line out the door. You get a ticket and wait for your number to be called. Smaller party gets seated quicker than larger parties as this place is relatively small (Even though they took up 3 store fronts). But the good thing is that their service is so quick and efficient that the wait time is usually short. Longest I had to wait was about 10-15 minutes. Hmm...what are some of my go to? I usually get two orders of their soup dumplings. The fillings of choice are pork and crab. The buns are delicate, soft and full of soup. What I also like is that the skin is not too thick like in order XLB places. They are always freshly prepared so you don't have to worry about getting frozen soup dumplings. Another favorite of mine here is the beef scallion pancakes. Crunch scallion pancakes paired with flavourful beef is something that I can get behind all day long. Just watch out for the grease that comes with it. Another must get in my opinion is their noodle soups. One of my fav is the shredded beef with pepper noodle soup. Generous amount of beefs paired with hot peppers are perfect ingredients for a cold winter day. For my sweet tooth craving and I think must gets are the hot soy milk and the dessert tofu (Dou Fu Fa). The soy milk comes in a bowl so you can dip your fried dough if you order some. The dou fu fa is skily smooth and the right amount of sweetness. Perfect way to end a meal with.I feel that you can't go wrong with the food here as they are cheap and good. Service here also isn't too bad as the waiters are pretty attentive and somewhat friendly. They mainly speak mandarin so I guess they'll be nicer if you spoke mando to them? Food here can sometimes get heavy because it is mainly carb base. So the food coma will hit you fast afterwards haha."

It kinda grossed me out. We got the cucumber veggie dish that was a nice pairing with all the meat dishes.I would spring for the soy milk and yo-tiao (fried bread) - that was a tasty starter.

I will give them another try but the pork with mustard greens was a completely different dish and the scallion pancake was not how they used to make it ( it tasted like the one I get at a regular takeout spot.. I think ownership and the chef might have changed. None of the original workers are there from what I could tell.  I had my food to go so I didn't noticed that my pork dish now had carrots, sauce, and other vegetables, none of which were mustard greens."

Came for dinner and the most difficult thing was finding parking. The food was good and tried the crab & pork xiao long bao which was very good, just as good as Joe Shanghai. The scallion pancakes were crunchy and the pan fried dumplings were very good. The pan fried udon was not great (I think they didn't wash the vegetables very wellAs I could taste grit in our order).

I've tired sweet soy bean milk, Chrissy dough, scallion pancake with slice beef, steamed crab meat and pork buns, pan fried dumplings, steamed pork buns.

I was a fan of Shanghai deluxe but then it closed down permanently. I've been searching for a backup in Chinatown but nothing really impressed me. Came here for lunch because of the awesome rating and review. There was a line when we arrived, but the line moves pretty fast, I was seated within 10mins for just two of us. ordered sweet soy milk, soup dumplings, pan fried dumplings, pig ear, chive pancake. The soup dumplings are big and thin skin, I love their soup dumplings because it's filled with so much soup and flavorful . the crab one also has strong crab flavor and you can see the crab meat. pan fried buns are crispy in the bottom and juicy inside. The only improvement is the pig ear that was not spicy which is a little bit disappointing. but in general. the experience was great. service is a bit slow from the high volume of people they are serving. small tip: cash only."

I was craving xiao long bao and had heard many things about this place so I was eager to check it out. It was around 10 pm and the place was still packed! Luckily we were able to get seated immediately.My friends and I ordered the Pig Ear, classic Pork Xiao Long Bao, and the Beef and Chili Pepper Noodle Soup to share. The Pig Ear dish was delicious! We ended up ordering another one because it was so good. This dish had the perfect texture and the restaurant did a good job of cleaning the pig ears so there weren't a lot of prickly hairs. The xiao long bao was excellent as well. They were filled with a generous amount of flavorful soup and the skin was just the right thickness. I would recommend passing on the Beef Noodle Soup. The soup was delicious and flavorful, but the noodles were flavorless and tasted a bit like sad spaghetti.Definitely stick with the classics like the Xiao Long Bao and skip on the noodles. If you are more of the adventurous type, try the Pig Ear as well!"

The rice cakes were very thickly cut and did not take up sauce, which left the dish devoid of flavor. The rice cakes were completely white in color as well, which makes me wonder if it's seasoned at all. The buns were not very soupy either.

I definitely recommend the pork option, but they do have seafood options as well. Secondly, I am never full with just soup dumplings, so I always opt for another noodle dish to share or to eat by myself (if I'm really hungry). I always go for pan fried udon noodles, crispy noodles or rice cake with beef. These dishes are all under $10 and make you feel full. Because of this, this place is almost always crowded (esp during evenings and weekends). So be prepared to wait a little, but I personally think it's worth the wait.

The flavor of the soup was exceptional and it was only enhanced by the chili oil and black vinegar.

We have been here a few times and the food is always good to  great. The soup dumplings here remind us of the ones we had at nan Xiang in Shanghai and are always good. The sesame pancake with beef is a hole run every time even if it's a little greasy. The seafood crispy noodle was a instant classic the first time we tried it so I suggest everyone to try it. With the food this good you know there will be a crowd and we go on Saturday nights so there is usually a wait but the wait is never long. The place is gritty and cash only so you gotta look past that to experience the great food that they serve.

I was perfectly OK when the waitress told me that I may have to wait for the pan fried buns, cause I understand they should take some time. But to my surprise, it turned out that the fried buns came out first, which means the buns were pre-cooked and kept in the oven. In fact, they were lukewarm and without any soup inside. What a mess!But I have to say their soup dumplings are super good. I am a big fan of Xiao Long Bao, and would like to go any restaurant as long as I know they serve good Xiao Long Bao. My demands are simple: thin dough, decent amount of soup, and good flavor. To me, their soup dumplings are the best at town. Their soup dumplings are worth 5 stars no doubt, but other dim sum and the cash-only rule pulls one star down.Highly recommend to everyone!"

Everything on the menu looked really appealing and they had great prices to match. Though I would have liked to order everything on the menu, we were limited by the space in our stomachs. We ordered a soy bean drink $1.75, garlic cucumber $4.95, pork XLB $6.50, and pork and crab XLB $7.50. - The soy bean drink was tasted homemade and was a great start to our meal 4/5- The garlic cucumber is a MUST get. It seriously is so good. There is a perfect balance of garlic, cilantro, and cucumbers. The cucumbers were crisp and fresh and so refreshing to eat. 5/5+- The pork XLB was piping hot when they brought it out. It had so much soup in there and the meat was well seasoned. Nom nom nom, my only gripe is that the skin was slightly thicker than I would like it to be. I would have to rank this XLB as one of my top 3 places to get XLB 4/5.- The pork and crab XLB was just as good and soupy. I just wish there was more crab flavor. Overall really good as well 4/5.Considering the food quality, price point, and wait time, this is definitely worth a visit and a MUST try and totally worth the wait.

We got there a little after 11 am and found huge crowd waiting around the enterance and stairs that leads to the main dining area. We then approached the hostess (a guy holding a clipboard) and told him how many of us, 30 mins he responded and handed us a piece of paper with a number on it. He was pretty spot on, he called our number after about 30 mins. We ordered soon after we settled down (looked at their to go menu while waiting to save time). We got four happiness sponge tofu, braised beef noodle soup, Shanghai pan fried udon, scallion pancake and 2 order of nan xiang xiao long bao. Sponge tofu came out first, followed by udon. I'm a big fan of their spong tofu, the flavor and texture are perfection, not too sweet and I can't get enough of it! Shanghai udon was good too but our toddler was having a hard time chewing it (our fault). Scallion pancake came out next and our little one was loving it! I, who dislike scallion in general, can't  get enough of it either because the amount of scallion in the pancake was not too overwhelming. Braise beef noodle soup came and we also liked it. It's not spicy for us but maybe for our LO it is. The beef was tender and noodle was perfectly cooked. The main star finally came, we all enjoyed it very much. We let it cool abit and when we ate it we were pleasantly surprised how the inside was still nice and warm. Our little one finished 3 of them. Overall, we are happy with our visit. Definitely will come back and will be our to go to place when we have guests in town."

You have to try the soup dumplings when you visit. They were delicious and very flavorful. What the waiter didn't tell us is how big they were (despite us asking), so we ordered two plates for two people and we were stuffed (in addition to other dishes). In addition to the dumplings, we also tried Shanghai shumai and scallion pancakes. I didn't realize the shumai was mostly rice-based, so it was super filling without too much flavor. The pancakes were OK and I think it's similar to what you will have at other restaurants. The service is a little poor and our waitress wasn't very friendly, but with that aside, the food here is worth a try.Tips-cash only like other restaurants-soup dumplings are large"

Juicy, steamy, hot and meaty! This is heaven! This place is fantastic! Everything is freshly made!I visited this location because the hotel I stayed in flushing(Hyatt) was like 2 mins walking distance so it was super convenient! Location wise, very accessible, indoor decor is ur typical chinese/Taiwanese cafe(cha chan ten style) or u can say dumplings n buns style if u would like, very casual. Price wasn't bad, level $$ in term of pricing but ofc it is also depends on what you order...I order the xiao long bao ofc, super juicy n tasty, highly recommending it! Just do it!Fried dumpling was also bit juicy as well, I like it too. Fried bun? Also juicy, meat was seasoned different ofc, this one is sweeter than the xiao long bao.Overall I really enjoyed this place, I would definitely go back to it! If my tummy could of fit more food I would definitely order more than I did!"

This review is solely for the XLB aka soup dumplings which were just OKAY. They tasted great, the pork was flavorful and yummy and not too greasy... BUUUUUT... they don't stay intact very well and the dumpling skin is on the dough-ier side. I prefer a thin skin that stays intact. If you like the thicker skin you might not like these either because they weren't super thick but right in the middle. I feel like the dough-ier thicker skin breaks easier because once it cools they dry out where as the thin skinned ones stay intact because they're slightly more stretchy and doesn't dry out. Overall service is exactly what you're used to at any Chinese restaurant in Chinatown or flushing, no fuss but they didn't need to be asked to refill our tea. I wouldn't come out of my way to eat here again, there are plenty of amazing soup dumpling places in Manhattan for decent prices. (6.50/6 dumplings here)"

Thankfully, this restaurant is also pretty late, even when nearby stores closed. The food here is pretty average, and their menu is rather limited for a Chinese restaurant. However, they prepare the food extremely quickly; your entire table's order will literally come out within ten minutes. Moreover, it is decently priced and not too expensive! The food would be more enjoyable if it wasn't too ready; we ordered a noodle dish and could literally see the oil dripping down the noodles. Other than that, the staff were very attentive and we were in and out of the restaurant within an hour!"

At Joe's, it's crowded and dark, you have to split tables with randos, and they serve their XLB over a bed of lettuce (which is cheaper for them, but makes your buns so soggy by the time you get to eat them!). Yes, Flushing is a little ways out but if you want good food, it is well worth the trek. Also, Nan Xiang is an easy walk from the Flushing Main St. station, and the 7 can take you straight into the city! My mom and I were torn over visiting either Nan Xiang or Kungfu Xiao Long down the street during our one Flushing dinner. We chose Nan Xiang in the end because its menu is Shanghainese through and through-- no chocolate buns (although props for creativity!) or other regional cuisine to pander to the masses. I think we made the right choice.We got an order of the scallion pancakes, potstickers, drunk chicken, garlic cucumber salad, two orders of XLB one meat one crab, and a cold sweetened soymilk all for $50 after tip. What a steal!! And we still had a potsticker and two XLB leftover, so the portions are quite mighty. I really liked everything we ordered-- the XLB were thin and didn't stick to the sheet lining the steamer. There's plenty of soup in them, so beware. The only thing is that the soup seemed more watery than oily and the XLB were a little on the large side (not conducive to popping them) but that's just me being a snob Shanghainese who has been spoiled over the summers in Shanghai! Their drunk chicken deserves special praise. My mom is a fiend for any chicken dish and she loved it. You can definitely taste the cooking wine which is great and the quality of the chicken is amazing. Notice how the chicken skin is yellow rather than white-- that's a GOOD chicken to use! Will absolutely visit again!!!"

The signature Shanghai stir fry was sitting on a bed of oil. The soup dumplings was mediocre. Even though this restaurant had back to back Michelin ratings, it just doesn't cut it for the taste. However, my favorite cold plate of beef tripe is still solid. The scallion pancake with beef is also tasty. I'm used to bad service in authentic Chinese cuisine spots, but today most of the staff was inattentive. Note: My rating is not based on the service. Things we had to ask for today: Tea. So basic right? Especially when it is 10 degrees outside. When the soup dumplings came, we had to ask for sliced ginger: TWICE. So our dumplings got cold and it just didn't taste good anymore. When we wanted to grab the staff attention, there were about five of them all on their phone. The staff wasn't rude, just wasn't attentive. Won't be coming back for awhile. There's Shanghai You Garden that tastes way better. No wonder their wait time is at least an hour."

We let my friends gf do the ordering for the table, she just selected a few items and we all shared. I will do my best to remember what all we had but I can tell you this everything was fantastic and not to expensive (maybe $10 a plate).

Not sure if it's a recent thing but I've come here on/off for the past 6ish years? Lately, the food doesn't seem to be great - it gets a lot more traction and is oftentimes very busy. Food still has the spice but it lacks depth of flavor. We ordered a few of the appetizers, the pad see ew and pad thai. Maybe it was a short period of time but the last year or so, we've seen the flavor and quality kind of diminish, hopefully they can turn it around.Also has a pretty small parking lot if you are driving."

The food used to be amazing, and I really hate to say it, but I'm not a huge fan of SriPraPhai anymore. I would give their food a 3/5, granted I only ordered Tofu Pad Thai and had their Appetizer sampler. I also ordered their Thai Iced Tea, and it was way too sweet for me. The Pad Thai was not good, it completely lacked the authentic flavor that I'm used to when having Thai food, and it tasted like it was highly sweetened instead of salted. It certainly wasn't what I was used to. There are plenty of really good authentic Thai restaurants in Woodside, and this place isn't one of them for me. The service wasn't the best either. It was completely empty on a Monday night, and we were still rushed out. I wasn't nearly done with my food, and were presented with our bill about 20 minutes in. I guess we overstayed our welcome. It's safe to say, I will not be coming back for a very long time."

Gets very busy during normal eating hours so best to come on off times. Staff seems to be running around a lot since many tables/ people to serve so service could be better. Food is spicy. Would definitely recommend. Downsides are the wait and the small parking lot. There is street parking nearby though.This second location of SriPraPhai is alot smaller but has much nicer decor. It also had its own parking lot which is great. And unlike the other location this one takes credit cards. The menu is identical to the other location.  They make a really delicious beef pad see ew and fried scallions. There's also a bar at this location so you can have drinks with your food. The staff is super friendly and attentive.  I really love this restaurant. The only reason I haveo it four stars is that they never have the mango sticky rice dessert.  Every single time it's not available.  They might as well take it off their menu.I had the pad thai noodles with shrimp, massaman beef curry, kao soy noodles with chicken, and the crispy watercress salad. All the dishes were delicious. Service was quick. Would highly recommend for anyone looking for good Thai food in Queens or Long Island.The go to thai spot authentic cuisine in a comfortable setting.

We always heard about this place and never got to try it so we walked in. The staff was courteous and sat us right away.PLEASE BE AWARE THIS PLACE IS CASH ONLY!!!!! Thank god I had enough cash on me walking in. They do a great job of making sure people realize this though by posting signs everywhere.We ordered chicken curry puffs to start. I thought these were pretty good and flavorful. I also really liked the vegetables and sauce that came with it to put into the puffs. I had the shrimp paste fried rice and my dad had the massamam curry. I thought mine was good but it really was one note and not too exciting. I also wasn't a huge fan that I had to mix everything together myself.My father's dish was amazing. Hands down the best massamam chicken curry I've ever had with huge chunks of chicken and potatoes and packed with flavor. This amazing dish saves the entrees.We wanted their sticky rice dessert but unfortunately they don't make it in the winter time so we will be back to try this and other dishes on this huge menu.*we were so hungry there are limited pics

Period.I first got to know about this place from a foodie colleague of mine, and came for dinner here with him and a group of his friends. Apparently the Chef is an old Thai lady who doesn't give an F about anything but good food.. when she got nominated for the James Beard award she said ""Who is James Beard?"" After being wowed in my first encounter, I dragged my fiancee as well. She has a better palate than mine, so needless to say she was amazed too. The intensity and balance of flavors is astounding. The dishes are not complicated, but rather basics done right.There was not a single bad dish there, so no cons at all! Here's what stood out from my two visits. Also keep in mind they are cash-only! What to get:Crispy watercress and seafood/chicken salad (A6 on the menu I think)- Skip the chicken and get with only seafood. Perfect appetizer- sweet, spicy, crispy, savory all playing tango inside your mouth! I cannot praise this dish more.Tom Yum soup- Beautiful fresh acidity. Crunchy lemongrass pieces are great to chew on.Khao soi- screams freshness. So aromatic, and perfectly balanced by the creaminess of the coconut milk.Jungle curry- again, very very fresh and herbacious. Also the green peppercorns are awesome!Meh:Pad thai: I've never had a good pad thai. This is one of the dishes I was expecting to be wowed by here, but it was a-ok. Definitely better than then other pad thai's I've had, with a good charred flavor (from what I don't know), but meh otherwise.Keep in mind:Tell them what spice level you want, else they'll make everything mild. The highest level of spicy is not too spicy, but can vary based on the dish."

Now obviously the location part is taken away. When we ordered the food for pick up it was honestly just not good, everyone in our party found something wrong with their food that wasn't there before. Another thing is how overpriced it was this time and compared to what we used to pay, this was absolutely not worth it and way too much for what the food was.

Been going there for 15 years! They also have another location in Long Island but the one in Queens is the best one. The only thing they changed is the shrimp cake. It was so much better before. I don't know why they changed the recipe to the fried shrimp cake or got another brand of shrimp cake. But please bring the old one back!! My favorite is the crispy pork with Chinese broccoli and soft shell crab. The raw shrimp is very good too! Pretty much all of their stuff is good. Gotta try it! The garden seating area is also pretty nice in the summer. Check out the pics. Oh they are cash only.

Literally. The pad thai was great. The minced pork with basil was amazing. Soft shell crab. The curry. The fried rice. Literally everything on the menu was amazing. The atmosphere is also resembles a small bustling restaurant in Bangkok - the waiters are all hyper but friendly, running around taking orders and dropping off food. I wish I could convey this atmosphere in words but you just gotta go there to experience it. Cash only by the way. Weird because their other branch out in Nassau county takes credit card, but the prices are also higher at the other branch. Maybe thats why."

There is so much to pick from that sometimes I don't know what to get and I get the same thing. Regardless it's amazing food. This is my husbands favorite restaurant and I can see why. The papaya seafood salad ( medium spice is very spicy FYI, well to me it is) is fresh light and perfect to start off with. Crispy pork is phenomenal with great flavors. Must order the fish w/ the sweet and sour sauce. Pair that with some coconut rice and it's outstanding. A great combo of flavors. The fish is very moist and it's fried so well that you don't have to worry much about the bones. Must try the coconut icecream which is homemade. It's a great ending to the evening. It's not overly sweet and it's topped with some peanuts and jellies. I ordered some to go as well."

We got lucky with parking, but you'll have to fight for street parking at certain times. Came again with a friend a couple of days ago and everything seems to be the same as I remembered.I started off with a Thai Iced Tea and the Combination Spring Rolls (Regular and Spicy) to share. I probably should've told them less sweet, but this was just as overly sweet as I remembered from last time (Okay, I really should've been smarter). I got the Red Curry with Chicken and a side of Brown Rice while my friend got the Pad See Ew. My Red Curry: The flavors were all there, but I didn't like how the texture of the curry was gritty. It seemed like they keep it boiling for so long that some vegetables or meat were disintegrating and creating that dissolved texture. I'm not mad about it, but I didn't enjoy it as much because of the texture. The flavors were perfect though and the medium spice level was that nice amount of spice for me! The Pad See Ew: Now, my friend is a huge fan of Kin'd because Kin'd tends to be more heavy handed with their flavors, aka saltier. I quote my friend when I say, ""The Pad See Ew is more mild than the one at Kin'd"". I don't think this necessarily is a bad sign, but I don't think my friend would come back as he prefers the flavors at Kin'd. I did taste that SriPraPhai's Pad See Ew was less flavorful than Kin'd, but I normally eat less salty so I thought it was okay. Service: The waitress that served us was super nice though! We asked to move outside and she warned us beforehand about bugs and caterpillars if we moved. Loved that she always had a smile on her face. Very sweet! Overall, both experiences were nothing spectacular and I wouldn't choose to venture out to Woodside just to eat here. If I'm in the area, I'll consider going here (also why I decided to try this place or a second time)."

Why bother when we've found the best one in queens? Maybe in all the boroughs.SPP is a large restaurant (seating 200+) and runs like a well oiled machine with a bar, to-go apps and snacks and a separate dining room next to the main and a splendid garden area. It seemed that everyone and their neighbor knows this spot that's boasts over 2000 yelp reviews with 4 stars that's situated off Roosevelt on a decidedly quieter block on 39th ave. Would've thwarted any trendy restaurant but not SPP- not when your food is so good and management this tight.We happily ordered duck salad, shrimp paste fried rice and fried trout with lemongrass sauce. The menu is 3 pages of interesting salads alone and get this- $4.50 beer. Not your run-of-the-mill Thai offerings with a bullseye lock on what diners feel are uber competitive rates. We were blown away by the delicious duck salad with generous thick slices of duck breast doused in sliced cherry tomatoes, red onions, papaya, cucumber, cilantro, peanuts, lime and fish sauce. Sweet, salty, spicy, tangy check. Only thing that could've improved was a bigger portion and white rice to sop up all the flavors. The fried rice was like another salad platter neatly plated with quadrants of julienned papaya, minced string beans, soy marinaded chicken, onions, egg, and dried shrimp. Definitely more subtle in flavor with all the fresh ingredients- it was a veritable poke rice bowl. The fish- oh my. We opted for the small and was explained it would be a filet of trout but what was served pretty much resembled a whole fish. Fluffy not unlike cod and dressed with an emulsified bevy of peppers, lemongrass and ginger. Sweet and tangy over a perfectly cooked fish that was tender and juicy. So darn good, I'd like to eat it twice and in fact requested extra rice with our leftovers. SPP exceeded all my expectations. The only regret i have is that my curiosity of the hard to pronounce namesake that presents like an Americanized Thai chain spot is anything but was not strong enough to compel me to visit sooner. I could've been having SPP all of 2018! Don't let that be you. (You're welcome)"

We tried out most of their menu. Today, their bbq pork - a22 has too much black pepper. It is usually my fave pick but not today. The salted beef fried rice is always on point - highly recommended if you like fried rice. Their green curry is good - we ordered the one with bamboo shoot instead of thai egg plant. It is way yummier. Their morning glory is good as well. This place is cash only so bring some cash in. Their service was so so. The waiter has to be called to fill in glass of water"

We made a reservation, came early, but were still seated right away!We ordered a whole bunch of dishes to celebrate a special occasion. We ordered the following:-Papaya Salad: Really good, on the top 5 best I've ever had. It was very citrusy, and was seasoned really well. Be careful of the chili peppers, I downed 3 glasses of water. -Fried Calamari: Basic calamari, simple and tasty. Sauce was good. -Chicken Satay: Chicken was very juicy and tender. Sauces were very good.-Crab Fried Rice: Very simple yet delicious, the way fried rice should be. Had huge chunks of crab!-Stir fried Chinese Watercress: Basic veggies, added to our order so we feel better about eating everything else. -Vegan Pad Thai: Special request for my grandma, and she loved it (she's a picky eater) Flavors were amazing, and they added various veggies for her to enjoy. -Stir Fried Seafood Trio: There was shrimp, fish, and squid. It was good, but nothing special that stood out. Portion was good though, just wish there was more flavor. -Shrimp Pad Thai: I had this to-go the next day, and it was still good. I love the different textures that are in the dish. Its not just noodles and shrimp. There were other lovely bits like tofu or some type of veggie. I can't have pad thai anywhere else now. -Steamed Fish in Banana Leaf: my grandma is an adventurous eater, and she likes fish. This dish is more of a traditional dish. There was a lot of strong flavors, so if you are not familiar with kaffir lime leaves or fish sauce, this might not be for you. Fish was cooked nicely, and coconut cream on top was a nice touch.Overall, this is one of the best Thai restaurants I have ever visited. There is a lot of options, and you can customize the dishes to your liking. They also have a huge vegetarian/vegan menu, so theres a lot of options for everyone. Not only was the food good, but the customer service was amazing. We had some food restrictions, and they had no problem running back and forth to check on the ingredients for us. Everyone was so nice, and accommodating. Highly recommend this place!"

Everything is good.Pad thai too and some funky salads specially the larb one's.Service :- day time was 3 stars but night time is just terrible i am mean terrible. The dude is telling me i ordered the same dish 2 twice. now why would i do that since i am with friends and they all know what they ordered! Hilarious. He took it back since it did not make sense to even his own people. On purpose the food was bland. Terrible service i swear.Long story short :- the food is good and atmosphere is cool too. The service from last night really shocked me. The dude literally told me we are closing in 10 mins and the time was 9:00. Basically eat up and get out. I mean i crave good food and can stand in lines for one but this was a bit to far.Good environment Food was nice ( depends on servers mood or kitchens )Terrible service Its just my opinion based on my experience."

I was pretty stuck between 4 and 5, but went with 4 because there are other Thai places I definitely prefer (eg Ugly Baby, Uncle Boons). Those felt more destination-worthy to me, whereas this felt like more of an outstanding neighborhood place.First visit, we started with the papaya salad (medium spice) and spring rolls, and then followed those with the penang curry (mild, for my wife) and the roasted duck green curry (extra spicy, for me). The spring rolls were good, but I'd be fine skipping those next time. The papaya salad was excellent, and basically a perfect summer dish. We really liked both curries as well -- I think I'd prefer the penang, if it had been the one with more spice, but both were great.Overall, a great spot that is well worth the trip."

It's hard for me to judge because I've only gone in recent years and I don't know what it used to be like. That said, I thought the savory food ranged from mediocre to pretty good, and the mango coconut sticky rice was a clear 5 stars. So I guess it averages out to 4 stars! I don't remember what I've gotten here besides the drunken noodles and an eggplant dish; I've eaten in and I've done take out. Do be careful with the spice level because they are not diluting the heat; I could barely enjoy my drunken noodles because they were so spicy. There was one time that a take out noodle dish came home ultra overcooked, but there have also been good meals. The prices aren't bad and I've never encountered a wait so I can't complain, but I don't think it deserves the cult following that I've heard about.That said, I've never had better mango sticky rice anywhere else; it's the real deal - sweet and salty with crunchy bits and a decadent coconut sauce. I can't not get it every time I come, and I haven't been anywhere else that serves such a comparable mango sticky rice. (If you have, please lmk!) And for that, I will always come back."

We got the seafood papaya salad, chicken larb, pad Thai, the red curry, and the sour curry with egg omelette. Everything was insanely good! The larb and egg omelette really stood out. For ground chicken, it was very moist and fresh. The sour curry was the perfect combination of sweet, spicy, and tangy (I believe tamarind-based), and the cubes of egg omelette were nice and fluffy, super effective in soaking up the perfect amount of curry!

Thank goodness my fear was unfounded!K and I went here for dinner. The front dining room was full of large parties and children. The second room (where we were seated) was filled with smaller groups and couples on dates.

The Larb was bright, refreshing and spicy. It was delicious! The beef was springy and had so many flavors: funk from the fish sauce, brightness from the lime and cooling taste from the mint. It was very addictive. The Khao soy was aromatic and rich from coconut cream. It was slightly sweet. The curry noodles helped calm the heat from the larb. I liked the little plate of mustard greens, red onions and extra egg noodles to add to the curry. The crab meat fried rice was moist, filled with crab and had a generous helping of fish sauce. It was wonderful. You could see the meaty crab legs and taste the occasional shell from the crab. Service was good.

The papaya salad was so fresh and flavorful, the portion was really generous, and it was the perfect dish to  have on a summer day. Pad see ew was so flavorful and the noodles and the meat were great. The dish with the pigs feet, was definitely the starter. The meet was fall off the bone, and the sauce was delicious.

As much as I hate to say this, I would skip the spring rolls next time, because although they are good they aren't as mind-blowing as the other appetizers. I didn't order it this visit but I also love their curry puffs and would order them next time instead. We had a classic shrimp pad Thai and massaman curry with a side of coconut rice for our entrees.  Both were amazingly delicious and neither of them are spicy, in case anyone is concerned with spice.Whether here or another one of their locations, I always highly recommend Sripraphai restaurant for authentic and reasonably priced Thai food."

The dressing is packed with intense flavor and the papaya shreds are crunchy and refreshing. You want to mix it all together with the crispy ground catfish which is a light, crunchy, and salty cluster of light brown matter placed next to the salad. I have no idea who thought grounding up catfish meat and deep frying it would make a good topping, but that man deserves to have his name remembered. The catfish gives a very nice textural contrast to the salad.The pork noodle soup was huge and delicious as always. It's packed full of pork of all kinds, sliced, balled, etc. The noodles can be had either wide or thin. We ordered wide. The broth is tangy and savory. Definitely big enough for 2 people.The Chinese broccoli with pork belly was nicely executed. The broccoli isn't overcooked and is appropriately seasoned. The pork belly is extremely crispy and offers a nice contrast to the slight bitterness of the broccoli.We also ordered Thai iced teas and coffees which you can never go wrong with.I don't give a lot of 5 star reviews but the consistency and quality of this place really does call for that 5th star.The service is good and prompt. The decor is clean and utilitarian. They only accept cash but have an ATM here that only charges a $1 fee.Get yourself over here now if you want the best Thai food in the city."

The restaurant isn't anything fancy or fabulous looking. They are known for delicious food and they deliver on that. There are lunch specials until 3 Pm for about $15. That includes an appetizer, entree and dessert. I decided to just order a separate entree and went with a favorite of mine: pad see ew with crispy pork. It was a generous serving and also very tasty. The Thai iced tea was very sweet but delicious over ice. The suggested dessert was a mango and coconut type of thick jelly. I didn't care for it but we tried something new. Overall, if you want good Thai, this is a great place to check or. Cash only."

We ordered the chicken satay, chicken and shrimp dumplings, and two orders of drunken noodles. I asked for the drunken noodles to be as mild as possible and they were still a bit on the spicier side (my fiancé asked for his order to be medium and it was the same level of spiciness as mine). However, the service was really great and our glasses of water were constantly refilled as soon as they were coming close to being empty, so I looked past the spiciness and still enjoyed my meal.We enjoyed our food and this will definitely be our go-to spot for thai food in Queens now.I was actually surprised at how great the chicken satay was, as I usually am not a great fan of it (from previous experiences at other places).It is cash only. There is a big sign on the door. There is an ATM machine inside.We did also notice that on the front page of the menu it states that you can bring in your own liquor for a fee (don't know what that fee is though)."

Fried Shredded Taro and Peanut - interesting to have but probably would not order again. Fried Curry Puff - not bad but not spicy. Green Curry - this was actually spicy, probably more than I can handle. Kao Soy - not bad, maybe a little too sweet for me. Sauteed Mock Duck - was actually the highlight of the meal, although it doesn't taste like duck, just a really nice tofu. Pad-See-Ew or Soy sauce noodles, as it says on the bill - pretty good version of this dish."

After a friend's birthday party in Jackson Heights, we seized our chance to come here for a late Saturday lunch. IT IS CASH ONLY. The menu is full of goodies. We had a feast of tom yum, papaya salad, beef larb, pad thai with shrimp, the roasted duck curry, and drunken noodles. (What more could one want in life?)The service was a bit slow in the slump of the afternoon. It took a while for someone to come over and take care of our order, but once we ordered everything came out in lightning fast time. Fair warning, they do put hot spicy pepper in the papaya salad so watch out for that burn!The tom yum is sweet and spicy. Sweeter than most tom yum, so be prepared for that. I loved that there were so many mushrooms floating around, and the to-share portion split amongst three was a good serving. The beef larb was flavorful and warm. I think it was my favorite protein dish, though the duck in the green curry was tender and delicious as well. The green curry was spicy and tasted rich with coconut milk. Just the right amount of spice, and the white rice soaked it up perfectly. We all loved the texture of the flat rice noodles in the drunken noodle dish, but preferred the flavor of the pad thai. Getting chicken in the drunken noodle was the only disappointing thing; I'd suggest getting a different meat. Overall, everything tasted authentic and delicious. The portions were larger than we thought, and we had plenty of extra food. I'd definitely come back! I'd even order take out and eat it at home if I could."

The fish was crispy and the sweet chili sauce was tasty. The whole dish was a bit too salty.Jelly desserts - Tasted ok but I would not recommend unless you are the type that likes to eat very firm jelly.Durian Ice Cream - Ice cream comes with peanuts and jelly on top. The ice cream was not very creamy and has a mild taste of durian. For $5, you get a very generous portion of ice cream."

The atmosphere is lovely with a lot of plants and flowers around and a small fountain. We ordered a BBQ Beef Salad for appetizer. So it's not really a typical salad with veggies but more like grilled beef seasoned with lime juice and stuff. It's really good trust me. I ordered the Chicken with ginger sauce over rice. The chicken wasn't too dried and I love the sauce! It also came with a bowl of chicken broth. All of the dishes we ordered were a big portion so keep that in mind. They have pages of dessert which is everyone's dream. I had the Lod Chong with ice and it was very refreshing and authentic. Price is reasonable and service is so-so. Definitely gonna come back to try more!

I used to crave SriPraPhai but this last visit things were meh at best. Everything skewed soooo sweet. The tum yum soup was practically sugar in hot water, the morning glory was fine, but both the pad thai and red curry was not what I used to love of this place. The taste palette is broad in strokes and geared for people who don't want delicate flavorings that Thai food has. Perhaps the immense amount of solid Thai in the area has made these guys rest on their laurels, but damn this is a fall from grace."

We were a table of 5 plus a baby and we waited around 15 minutes for outdoor seating on a Sunday night around 7pm. The restaurant was busy throughout our dinner but service was pretty fast and efficient. To start we got the watercress salad, roasted duck salad, and chicken larb. My favorite is always the watercress salad. The fried crunch goes so well with the salty squid sauce that comes on the side. The larb had a good kick to it which I enjoyed but can be too much of other people who can't tolerate spicy foods. My friend ordered for us so I can't really say what was delicious but the green curry was fantastic with the coconut rice. The pineapple fried rice was ok. I preferred eating the coconut rice with the different meat dishes rather than just fried rice. Will def be back here when craving Thai food."

I think we lucked out because a large table got up right before we came in.The staff was very nice. I ordered a bunch of appetizers for the table to share and we all ordered our own entrées.

They do not take reservations and it's cash only so come prepared! They have a full bar and a gigantic menu, which can be a bit overwhelming since there is just so much food to choose from. There were four people in my party so we ordered a few appetizers and a few dishes for dinner. Apps: large tom yum soup, medium spicy papaya salad, and chicken satay. The tom yum soup is delish it is one of my all-time favorite soups, I think it was the best I've had so far, the spice level was perfect it had a bunch of mushrooms and some shrimp, I wish there were shrimp though. The papaya salad was ok, it didn't taste fresh and it was a bit soggy, I found it had an overpowering fish taste. The spice level was enough. I didn't have the chicken, I was chugging tom yum soup, but the group said it was good.Dinner: Drunken noodles, chicken pad see ew, beef basil fried rice, fried chicken with nuts and pineapples. Everything mentioned was great, but the beef basil fried rice took the cake, the beef was sliced thinly, cooked well, complementing the fluffy fried rice! The drunken noodles were also very good, the noodles were wide, but thinner than usual, which I liked. The chicken with nuts and pineapples is your classic sweet and savory combo, a slightly too sweet for me, but still tasty. I didn't try the pad see ew because I was busy with everything else, but it got rave reviews. We ended the dinner with my fav, green tea ice cream, it was good, not the best, I enjoyed it, unlike the others who couldn't understand the taste. Overall dinner was great, the price was decent, parking was tough, and the service was average. I'd like to go back to try the pad thai until we meet again SriPraPhai!"

It's soft and delicious, but doesn't soak up the flavor of the papaya. Seems odd when combined with the salad.- spice level here too mild. Even the extra pepper on the side seems too mild. Probably caters more to the American crowd.- drunken noodles good, but playground Thai does it much better. -waiter didn't come to check on us or refill water throughout the whole meal. Overall this place is awesome, but in some ways Playground Thai does it better. It just goes to show that no matter how good you are, there's always an Asian that does it better."

We had to ask for our water glasses to be refilled. We ordered a pineapple fried rice and a shrimp pad Thai, I felt like I was eating the same dish. Although the ingredients were different, Ihad the same flavor profile, there was no punch to the food. It wasn't bland per se, it just had no personality."

However, when you are a New Yorker with pizza mileage under your belt (Arturo's, Totonno's, etc), you basically feel that the media hype is based on out-of-towners or lazy complacent people who kept deluding themselves into thinking that there is something special about that place.   The same issue hits SriPraPhai.  Sure, it's the first authentic Thai place in Queens 15 years ago. NYT/NY Mag/New Yorker/The Village Voice used to rain rants and raves upon it, usually about how its original dinky storefront had some serious culinary magic.  I am sure there are plenty of people who only goes there because of its past fame, or the fact that it's relatively swanky with an outdoor fountain (which is irrelevant when you are dining during the colder months).  That being said, a lot happened in local Thai within the past 15 years - there's Ayada, Arunee, Zab Elee (late and lamented, but great for midnight Esan), the 2 Chao Thais, 8 Paet Rio, Playground and Boon Chu.  Each of them are great in their own ways.  But what I can tell you is what SriPraPhai isn't good for - making Thai standards.  Well, let's see - let's compare 3 dishes.  N1 Shrimp Pad Thai This is pretty much the standard to how I judge Thai restaurants.  SriPraPhai's version was sticky, overly sweet and lacks any firepower (the Cantonese term wok-hay, or the certain toastiness that you get in a stir-fry when it was done on a hot wok in canola or peanut oil), and it lacks any serious flavor.  It tasted like something someone could make in their apartment kitchen using a standard stove.  I personally measure any Pad Thai with the version from Boon Chu, which is hot from the wok and features crisp strands of egg, tofu strips and mung bean sprouts along with shrimp that has the smoky finish of a well made stir-fry, well balanced with fish sauce, tamarind, peanuts and soy.  This was not it, and it's not good at all.O12 Gai Yang Combo - Barbecue chicken combo with coconut fried rice and papaya salad This is similar to the barbecue chicken that I had at Zabb Elee (their village location still exist).  On the SriPraPhai version the Papaya salad isn't bad, in fact, it was quite spicy with crisp textures and fruity notes, and the coconut rice was coco-nutty and that coconut cream unctuousness without being mushy.  However, the chicken was moist but flavorless.  It didn't taste barbecued (not smoky) as much as it was griddled without much marinate.  In the Zabb Elee version the chicken was smoky, spicy and a bit dry, which is actually the style that I was looking for - great with sticky rice and whatever salad you have on hand.  So that one is a bit of a fail. C14 Pad Gra-Prow - Ground meat with basil, garlic and chilesWell, this was by far my biggest disappointment with SriPraPhai - a good Pad Gra-Prow is supposed to be loud - salty, garlicky, fresh basils, packed with spices and some heat from the chiles.  It's meant to be the thing that drives you to eat more rice.  In the Sripraphai version it was much more subdued.  I asked the server to knock the heat down a little (stomach issues), but what I ended up with was an across-the-board lowering of volume, like someone took the food and turned it down to 2 (instead of up-to-11) - it was bland.  I mean, wow, what happened there?  Man, compared to the version at Ayada where they get flavor down without the heat, this one doesn't make the grade.To be honest, it was not a bad place - the interior looks great and the service was decent.  If I didn't get sticker price shock from them ($50 for 2 people including tips, which is about 20% more than the usual), I would go there if I am in Woodside and looking for okay food.  The problem is that I am not looking for ""okay"" Thai.  If I want okay Thai I know a ton of places...I want great Thai, and despite the hype, this is not great."

While a clean, family friendly restaurant, the main attraction is found wanting. SriPraPhai decides to throw away any notion of flavor in favor of authentic stubborn stagnation. Evolution, change and elevation of a dish is integral to great food, this is anything but above average and not deserving of the accolades it currently holds. Before the advent of mass produced soap, one could say it was authentic to serve food in a place where the staff did not wash their hands. I ask please SriPraPhai, please wash your hands(figuratively of course)."

They don't take reservations so they told me to just call 30 minutes beforehand. I commend the staff for giving us such impeccable service especially when the orders can get confusing with so many people. The only ""mistake"" they made during our whole meal was one person's order got really delayed. It came out when everyone was almost done eating. But I don't blame the restaurant for it. I think they did the best that they could already which is why I'm giving them five stars. They also had an extensive menu and decent food. I got to try the seafood fried rice, fried calamari, pad see ew, and crab and chicken wontons. The seafood fried rice was very addicting. Tasted very light and the seafood bits were a nice addition. Fried calamari was good, nothing special. I've had better pad see ew at another place that closed down but SriPraPhai's version is not bad either. However, I definitely don't recommend the crab and chicken wontons. Didn't look appetizing and didn't taste good either. Some people got desserts but their mango sticky rice was not an option because mangos weren't in season. All four cars managed to find parking around the block."

Been to SriPraThai Woodside for many years. This is probably the last time I am going there. I give a star to the staff/servers and a star for the freshness of the shrimps they used. That's about it. I almost feel bad for giving it two stars but it does not deserve more. The food was no good and the price has gone way up. I honestly can get better authentic Thai food elsewhere in the neighborhood at a much more pocket book friendly place. So what's wrong? You know while your neighbors are making Thai food from scratch, with real ingredients like lemon grass, gingers, curry spices, and real chilly peppers. Your customers can probably taste the instant spice mix you are using as a short cut?! The Tom Yum Soup I ordered was very sour. I finished it anyways because I came on a chilly day. I was freezing. But honestly I can make Tom Yum Soup at home just like yours with a jar of Tom Yum paste I get from an Asian supermarket. The green mango salad with seafood has more seafood than mango. Fine. It's 12.50 you need to justify it. I get it. But the flavor profile of the salad was weak. The mango was very sweet and very finely shredded. I want more mango that's why I ordered this!! I've had better mango salad from a no name Thai restaurant than here! Seriously! What made me really upset was the so called drunk man noodles! From the first time I had it here, this very location in 2008, this is the worst one I've had! There is no way I was at SriPhraThai! This five ingredient Dumrunkman noodles: noodles, tomato, a few sad piece of bell pepper and basil, and the boiled mock duck -- was soggy and sad. Instead of stir frying the noodles and other ingredients to give it a nice char. This was like mixing all the boiled wet ingredients together. I doubt they used a wok to cook this. Really??!?!! I would never expected a drunk man noodles of this quality from here. Were you using a tempt-cook tonight? I couldn't finish it. I had five bites, the max. The Khao Soy with Chicken was really meh. It was like mixing a bag of instant ramen mix with coconut milk. Have you tried Mama's instant noodles curry flavor? Look for it in an Asian supermarket. It costs $1.5 a bag the most. This Khao Soy tasted just like that. Not sure we could find any real spices used in the dish; everything tasted very artificial. Sigh... This restaurant needs a little more love for food. This is not the same place I used to go and look forward to my next visit. No more! No thank you! I reviewed its Hillside Ave location a few months ago, referencing how the food was better here in Woodside. I am taking it back. Sorry."

I dined there with three others on Thursday, 8/10. Although this is a good restaurant worth returning to, it is not entitled to the aforementioned praise.The restaurant is convenient to mass transit, one nearby subway train being the 7, as well as the Woodside LIRR station. It is in easy walking distance from both. Forget about parking which, in Queens, is as relevant as the tooth fairy. The casual storefront space is much larger than it seems and acoustics are not bad so conversation is possible. I ordered a large Saki to put a glow in this meal.The servers were pleasant and efficient and our dishes arrived much sooner than one would expect. The  Tom Yum Soup was savory and delicious with a nice coconut flavor. Duck Salad  was ""on point"" (I hate that phrase!!). The two Sausage Salads we ordered were appropriately fatty and nicely seasoned. The Fish Cakes were yummy with a nice soft texture.Onto the entrees. The Chicken with Glass Noodles was superb. The chicken was tender and the noodles had fabulous texture.We ordered three curries and I was a little disappointed by each. The curry dishes were Penang Beef Curry, Massaman Shrimp Curry and Shrimp Green Curry. We asked for a medium spice level but the curries were each EXTREMELY mild with no evident heat. The curries were ""dumbed down"". What a shame because each of the curries had wonderfully complex flavor. If you go here, INSIST upon the level of heat you desire.The last dish I tried was the Fried Catfish. I do not recommend this dish since it was all breading with little visible evidence of fish.BOTTOM LINE: SriPraPhai Thai is a good, not great, restaurant. I would not hesitate to dine here again, however."

I normally order the papaya salad at Thai restaurants but I've never had one that was spicy! I love spicy and thought that this was the best papaya salad I've ever had. My bf had to look for papaya for me because I could not stop eating it! It made my tongue hurt but it was worth it.The curry puffs were pretty good. It was my first time having them so I can't really compare them to another previous occasion. But I'd much rather stick with the papaya salad.I ordered the Chicken Pad Thai and I would have to say it was pretty similar to other pad Thai I've had. It didn't stand out much but they did give a huge serving that I ended up taking the rest to-go. My bf ordered the Drunken Noodles which were just as good. They had a spicy kick to it and there was a good amount of basil incorporated in the dish.Overall, SriPraPhai did not disappoint. The main dish that stood out to me was the papaya salad and I would travel out to Woodside for this. The other dishes, I can probably find a Thai restaurant near me that can satisfy my cravings. Also, Cash only. And tip: if you go around 7PM, you are almost guaranteed to find parking in less than 10 minutes."

I met a friend here during lunch, when we practically had the place all to ourselves, and we enjoyed all we ate. It was just as I expected. I was thinking of who I could bring to the restaurant with me for repeat visits, because it's in my neighborhood. But, I noticed odd lack of hospitality and passive-aggressive behavior. Our water refills stopped before and after the check came. Admittedly we were caught up in conversation so we waited a while to pay. We even entertained the idea of ordering desert. After we paid and tipped 20%, we were ignored. So, we changed our minds about desert and asked a waiter, who had recently started their shift, for some water. The waiter, hesitant, came over, refilled our glasses, but not without emphasizing that we'd been there a ""VERY long time."" Yes, we had, but that comment was uncalled for. It was obvious that the other staff told that waiter about our being there a while after paying. There were not many other customers there the whole time we spent there either. To add, it was also very obvious that they were talking about us in front of us. Finally, before we even left the table, with our bags on the table still, that same waiter rushed to clean it. There were literally SO MANY empty tables in the place. That was so off-putting. Perhaps that's why so many tables were empty. With so many other options for authentic Thai in NYC, that offer quality service AND a great ambiance, I'm fine with having tried the food here just once."

That got me really excited so the noodle dish would have to wait. I got dumplings, Tom Yum with shrimp, and I believe basil chicken with rice. Let me explain to you about their hot sauce. Every thai restaurant has their staple of hot sauce. Some places have a variety while, every place has the standard red hot sauce with the bits of the seeds. So per usual, I ask for hot sauce and I got 3 different types. Standard. The pickled concentrated version and one that I haven't seen before. I try the new one and I gradually begin to notice that it's hot. Not the usual spiciness but the kind where you finish your iced coffee and have to order a second in order to not start crying. So when the lady comes to clear the table and give us our bill, I ask her what's in the hot sauce. People. THIS. IS. NOT. ORDINARY. HOT. SAUCE. This is Thai chillies in which they would dry on rooftops back in Thailand.  But here they just dry out the peppers in the oven. If you're familiar with Indian cuisine you know the dried peppers packs a much stronger heat that the ordinary ones. I wasn't dealing with ordinary spices but thai level spices AND DIDNT DIE. Definitely an accomplishment. The food was definitely delicious. Portions were massive. Staff was very sweet and engaging in conversation. They have the beautiful fountain in the back. I can't wait to come back. The only drawback would be cash only. But that really is a small setback to the wonderful dishes you are about to experience."

Not much else or much different to say. The food is definitely worth all the praise even with all the newer Thai restaurants that have popped up. SriPraPhai was the first to make the outer boroughs, specifically Queens, a destination for Thai food. I love getting the catfish salad and the grilled pork neck. Also when I'm in the mood for fried foods I'll get the crispy watercress salad. I also love the panang curry here. On a recent visit I got the broiled chicken over chicken stock rice, the chicken satay, and fried taro. I got the ground chicken with basil as well and sigh forgot to request the fried egg but still a delicious and flavorful dish. I've never had a bad meal here. I always leave full and satisfied, happy for the treat and for not breaking bank. Great selection of desserts in the fridge too if you want to take it to go."

The restaurant was packed at 8pm, but there's plenty of seating for large groups. We sat outdoors in the backyard patio (think: outdoor chairs, umbrellas, string lights, garden).I ordered a Chicken Pad Thai and actually didn't like it. Did not taste authentic and wasn't made very well. It was bland and didn't have a wok heat flavor. The Chicken pieces also was very dry. The Pork Tender Jaew dish on the other hand wasn't bad. But overall my pad thai was so disappointing it affected my judgement of all the other dishes.Also the menu is huge... like thick stack booklet huge. It was hard to look through the menu. Ambiance was pretty chill. Service was attentive."

Plus NYC isn't famous for space so it's refreshing they manage to acquire that much of it. For a group of 4 including drinks and appetizers the final amount was $110 (excellent). I had the duck drunk noodles which was good when it comes to the noodles consistency and the overall flavor of the dish. It was not greasy and the duck added even more flavor but their mild spicy is more hot spicy, they need to bring that down a notch. We also got their bbq pork (not sweet like typical American bbq) with papaya salad (very good salad mix) and coconut rice (hardly noticed the difference from regular rice). We also got a green curry and a red curry. The red curry was a bit too greasy on top, almost swimming in oil but the flavor was good. I preferred the green curry here compared to other places where I preferred the red curry. Their Thai ice tea was strong but it came with a lot of milk, yummy. Their lychee ice tea has lychee in it but doesn't have much flavor. And we had the crab and chicken puffs which was good. I will go here again to retry everything to confirm if there's consistency and with prices like that, I probably visit often."

I tried SriPraPhai for the first time today and actually think it has become my favorite Thai restaurant in New York. The food was amazing! My hubby and I ordered Papaya Salad, a small Tom Yum Soup, Pork Leg Over Rice, and two glasses of Pinot Noir. Everything was great. Top-notch Thai food for a great price. The Papaya salad was on point, portion, taste, and price-wise. The Tom Yum soup was a little on the sweet side, and I like it to be more on the sour side, but still better than quite a few Thai restaurants, and everything in it was delicious. A little smaller than I expected though. Pork Leg Over Rice is usually always a good option. It is a star-anise based dish. Very flavorful. Pinot noir was pretty standard. Everything comes out pretty quick and tasting great. They have a whole vegetarian menu too!Service was pretty good. And their bathroom (well, I only saw the ladies room) is pretty clean. I don't normally mention bathrooms in my reviews but I just felt so comfortable here. Indoor space is dimly lit and can be great for romantic dinners OR eating out with friends. I didn't get photos of the inside of the restaurant because we chose to dine in their outdoor/backyard garden, but the whole place was spacious. I did get a video of the outdoor area though, which was very lovely (Cannot add it to this post, so I'll upload it separately). Oh, this place is also CASH ONLY. Definitely will be going back!!!"

I frequent about once a month and the food is always consistent, always fresh. The restaurant gets jam packed during weekends. They don't take reservations but you don't usually wait more than 30 minutes. The menu is hard to parse through as there are tons of options and pages -- I usually hate too many options at a restaurant but don't totally mind it here.The soft shell crab appetizer is an excellent starter. All three options you can get with the soft shell crab are excellent. The green curry, red curry, pad see ew, drunken noodles, pad Thai, and Cal Soy are wonderful. It's filling, it's fresh, it's beautiful!!! One thing to note is that their spice level is very extreme - their spicy will make you chug water like crazy. So, be cautious. For dessert, their mango with sticky rice is good, but they have a lovely section in the fridge of Thai desserts than range from 3-5 dollars. They're delicious. All are a must try."

I wait for long time and finally get my order. The soup lack of favor and the fat noodle is too sticky. I find the other Thai restaurant ( chao Thai ) makes better than them. I think is place is overrated by people. I don't get it. The Whole meal, the server not even come to ask and follow up. Forget about this spot if u want to enjoy your thai food. Never come back."

I thought Thai food was all about the pad Thai and pad see ew but I was so wrong.I got to come here with a big group which means I was able to try a lot of things on their menu.I'm not sure what this dish was called but it was this fried fish with a spicy mango salad. that was honestly the best dish there. Also, their soft shell crab is so damn good. If you like spicy, their curries will set a fire in your mouth straight down to your stomach. Honestly, it seems pointless to try to describe my experience here because you just have to go and try their food. I doubt anything on their menu will taste bad. Just stop reading the reviews here, jot the address down, and come here for a delicious meal."

It was pretty packed but we were able to get a table. The wait staff was extremely friendly and helpful. The constantly kept our waters full which helped with the spicy food.We started with the Shredded Mango Salad and curry puffs. The Shredded Mango Salad was really refreshing with the mango, cilantro and seafood. It had a little bit of heat with some sweetness. The curry puffs were nice and hot! The insides were delicious.For our entrees we got Green Curry, a side of Coconut Rice and Drunken Noodles. The Green Curry was pretty good with lots of coconut milk mixed in. It didn't come with rice so we had to order our own but the Coconut Rice was perfect with it. The Drunken Noodles had a nice stir-fry flavor and a good amount of heat to it."

I stopped coming after the expansion because the few times I was there I felt like the service and food were both lacking .. perhaps growing pains. Went there two weeks ago and well... can't stop thinking about eating there.  The food took me back to Thailand ... my waiter was the same little boy who used to help his parents back in the day.. now he's a grown man and so kind and humble.  Going to Sri is like going home ...

I thought the food was good but not as good as it was hyped up to be. The service was very accommodating. The staff was friendly and made sure everyone was well attended to. They were nice to provide a separate kid friendly setting for a toddler.

Both times had poor service and food was only so so.  Think there are better places to have authentic Thai where the experience will be far more pleasant.  This place is basically a cafeteria with so so food.  Try somewhere else.

This our first time at the restaurant.Negative:-sign on inner door as you come in ""do not leave valuables in car"" or something to that effect. Wish I took a picture. -you are charged $10 if you bring your own alcohol/cake, it's literally printed on the menu. If they posted this on their door I would of reconsidered going in. We brought birthday cake. -fried catfish dish, waitress tells us ""little fish"". Saw pics on yelp decided to try it. Where's the fish? We tasted the essence of fish but it's like a mouthful of shredded panco. -tom yum soup was not good at all. No one in the party was able to finish it. It was very sour.Positive:-Pad Thai was yummy-mango salad was refreshing-nice! That they put WiFi passcode on menu They have a fridge up front where they have a large selection for the take out crowd. Desserts and what not. Wish we tried some of that. BUT we were so put off by the $10 charge for birthday cake I don't know if we'll come back."

At least I didn't have to wait: at 5:15pm there were plenty of tables. The food was plenty, but the quality was just ok. Papaya seafood salad: big portion, but boring taste; the seafood was clearly pre-frozen, and had no taste. Larb with ground pork: just ok; the minced pork had a lot of tougher cartilaginous pieces that I couldn't chew. Drunken noodles with sliced pork, although the meat was dry and tough, the noodles were good. Sautéed crispy pork belly with chili, garlic and basil leaves: although the flavor of the pork belly was good, you could tell that it had been cooked earlier, and waited for a while. Ripe mango with sticky rice: delicious. Their house red wine (1/2 liter for $9) is pretty good, and a true bargain. Overall, I'm not sure it's worth to come here anymore. Even though they give you a lot of food and have a lot of choices, they have so many dishes that it's impossible for them to cook them expressly for you... and it tastes accordingly. I have a personal attachment to this place, and will probably end up coming back (but not for a while). However, I wouldn't wait to eat here. It's just average quality Thai ""comfort"" food, way too popular than it should."

One of the best thai place in ny and I've tried a lot of them. Branch out and order something other than a pad thai and you'll be rewarded. With that said, my go to order includes crispy pork belly with chinese broccoli, sauteed water spinch aka best veggie dish in the universe. Last time we tried the jungle curry which includes a very spicy but addicting curry sauce, your meat of choice, and veggies such as thai baby eggplant, bamboo shoots. Despite the waiter's repeated warning that it would be extremely spicy, we went with it and it was definitely spicier than most things but not too the point of me drenching myself in water after each bite. That said, know your spice tolerance and enjoy a super extensive menu of delish things. Be adventurous!!"

Something about the dishes that didn't taste 100% Fried rice was a bit too saucy and the Thai ice tea was too sweet. The lunch menu was a great deal though.

I cannot speak for its authenticity, however I can say that the menu has dishes that one would not commonly find in a generic Thai restaurant. Seriously, if a Thai restaurant just has curries and permutations of meat, it could do better. When a Thai restaurant starts to have dishes like the roast pork and crispy pork and sausage over rice with the egg, that starts sounding legitimate. Or maybe the larb salads? How about the Esan sausage? SriPraPhai has all of those. And with a crowd every time I go there, I can say this is a restaurant I can trust.I'd be honest, I wouldn't go here for dishes I could go elsewhere. This is not a comment to quality. My premise is, the curries can be found everywhere else but that these other Thai dishes not usually found should be tried. That said, I'm a sucker for the Northern Thai sausage or Esan sausage and I almost always get that roast pork/crispy pork over rice. They also have a pork leg over rice as well as combos that feature roasted chicken or grilled pork meat with sticky rice. With respect to the roasted pig combo, the roast pork is always a little sweet especially after I dipped it into that sweet bean sauce. The crispy pork always maintains that crunch. The sausage dish is always good too. They usually serve them sliced with some peanuts and the lettuce. Ideally, they should be wrapped with the lettuce to eat. I just use a fork. One of them, the Esan or the Northern, was spicy. And I recall the Northern sausage resembled like meatballs. Nonetheless, I usually get these on my visits. But even if I got the same thing every time, somehow I fell in love with the food here. The waitstaff are generally friendly, but because of how busy the place is they're probably too stressed to make extra talk. The ladies up front may appear a little surly especially on weekend evenings."

It was a legit symphony of flavor - mint would pop out of nowhere then beautifully subside into basil all with perfectly tangy undertones... I honestly can't even describe how much I liked it.  Everything else we ordered tasted like garbage in comparison, but I hear it was all pretty good hahaThere was a book of a menu too and you could order every combination of foods I can think of so the options are limitless.The dessert case was beautiful too."

This restaurant definitely looks like a place where families like to frequent, and I liked the vibe. We got the curry chicken puffs which were really good. The inside was like a mash of potatoes and chicken. It came with some pickled onions and cucumbers in a fish sauce (I think) and it was delicious. We also ordered drunken noodles with chicken which was just mediocre and had a very, very strong basil taste. My boyfriend got the gai yang combo which was okay - a bbq chicken dish with coconut rice and papaya salad. We asked for these two dishes to be ""a little bit spicy"" and we got mild which was not spicy at all. Overall, the dishes were alright - not insanely good, but I'd come back. This place is cash only, and the prices seemed to be standard thai prices."

First, this place only accepts cash, something I carry very little of. Even small snack stands accepts credit cards these days. Second, the waiter was not very attentive. We never got our waters filled and he never came to check on us during the meal to see how we were doing.Other than that, the main courses were amazing. We ordered some appetizers to start, which were okay, not fantastic. The Thai wings were salty with a hint of sour. They were fried really well, with a crispy skin. The calamari was okay. The sweet and sour sauce was good, but the calamari itself wasn't the best. The papaya salad was really good. The papaya was fresh and crispy. The flavor was fantastic. For the main courses, we got the drunken noodle, pad Thai, pineapple fried rice, sautéed chicken, and Penang curry. There were five of us, and this was way too much food. We were only able to finish the sautéed chicken. The other main courses were only half eaten. In short, all the dishes were delish. Bill came out to about $105. Defiantly one of my favorite Thai restaurants in NYC."

SPP definitely has the larger menu and can absolutely slam it out of the park when they do things right, but in the half dozen times I've been here in the past few years, I feel like the quality of the food greatly varies from day to day, which I don't want to contend with whenever I go somewhere. Also, I'm not sure if it's still the same, but having to pay in cash only is quite a nuisance.Yes, the lunch special can be an absolutely great deal, but the few times I've ordered a lunch special menu item, I've been let down. If you happen to be dining in for lunch, I would absolutely urge you to order off their regular menu instead.However, I would still say that yes, this place is worth checking out for fairly authentic Thai fare. It's been around for over 2 decades for a reason. 3.5 stars really, but rounded down because of that annoying cash only clause."

I honestly don't know if they could really call it tea. It was almost like a milkshake. It was very tasty, but I wish it wasn't so sweet/thick.Pad Thai - decent. I have had pad thai so many places; some stand out and some do not. Although the pad thai was good, I have had better. It was a big portion, so I got 2 meals out of it.I also tried the crab fried rice and the sliced basil beef - both were really good. The menu is extremely overwhelming...which is why I just went with pad thai. Too many options! Pages and pages and pages long. I would recommend looking at it online before coming.

Not sure how old this place really is, but my parents always came here back in the day. If you're in the Woodside area, it surely is a must! Although this place is no longer the ""hidden gem"" of Woodside, Queens, the food and ambience is still good. Prices are decent but not entirely cheap. They have an extensive menu beyond Pad Thai and Thai iced tea so make sure to explore as much while you're here. My favorite noodle dish here is the Gai Kua, a flat noodle dish with peanuts, chicken, squid, and cilantro. The apps are a great addition as the entree may not entirely be filling if you haven't eaten much. Try their curry puff and spring rolls. If you aren't full, dessert is a must! Sticky rice, sweet soup, and ice cream dishes can be ordered here. There's also a sweets section to-go at the cash register. In warm days, they have outdoor seating which may get a little itchy if mosquitos are out. It does feel very homey outside as it's a backyard setting. Service is fast and friendly. Cash only!"

Parking was easy to find also which was great. Their menu is like a maze. They have so many items on the menu; we spent good 10 mins going through each items. Crispy chicken, duck entree, dumpling, Tom soup, shrimp fried rice, papaya salad, beef skewers and the drinks. The bill came out to be about $80 for the two of us. The food was delicious and service was very efficient. One thing I didn't like was at the end, it started getting busy so the waiters started to rush things. I wasn't even done eating but the server took my food to pack it for Togo. Rude. Whatever."

Come early or a little later pass 2pm during lunch/brunch if you don't want to wait for a table.We did family style because we wanted to try diff types of dishes. Keep in mind that their portions are pretty small. Slightly disappointed tho.Duck noodle soup: 4/5 the broth was just PERRRFECCT! It wasn't too sweet or too meaty (if you know what I mean lol) or too bland. Generous amount of shredded duck meats. Papaya salad: 3.5/5 who comes to Thai resto and not order papaya salad? It was def spicy even tho we asked for mild spicy. I felt like the sauce was lacking, it was missing something. slightly disappointed. Pad thai with shrimp: 4/5 you know this pad thai was good when my father who doesn't like Thai food finished this dish lol! It wasn't too sweet or bland because you know some Thai restaurant either make it too sweet or too bland, but here the flavor was HITTTING IT. Basil minced chicken with rice: 4/5 first time ordering this dish and comes to my surprise it was pretty good! I think this dish might become one of my fav thanks to SriPraPhai. Raw shrimp salad: 3/5 THIS IS SO SPICY EVEN THO WE ASKED FOR MILD SPICY -- because there's chili pepper. slightly disappointed with this salad because the flavor was just not there, it is missing a kick. I guess one of the reasons I gave this place a low rating because of the service. 1) we barely even sat down or looked at the menu and the server/runner kept asking if we wanted anything to drink from the menu 5X. like for real we literally just got here and didn't even have the chance to look at the menu. 2) when we were looking at the menu deciding what to order the server repeatedly asked us if we were ready to order. 3) they collected our plates, utensils, and bowls when we weren't done eating. like yes, I got it, we only had one dish that is about to be finish but like can you wait until that dish was finished first and then collect our plates, utensils and bowls. 4) we were still hungry so we asked for a menu and they repeatedly kept asking if we are ready to order dessert, like no -- in the end, we decided to order a dessert because there wasn't anything we were particularly interested or wanted. we wanted to try the mango with sticky rice but the server told us that mango is not in season so they don't have anything with mango. then why didn't you say so from the beginning that there are no mango desserts?? IDK if this is considered a Thai style service but like I just don't like the feeling of being rushed from the moment we came in to the moment we are leaving. I get it when it is busy or during rush hours but it wasn't like crazy busy esp after we finished our meal. Would I come back? Prob just because the food was pretty good. Just prepare to be rush throughout your stay if you do come during busy hours. OH BRING CASH W YOU!"

Well, that's exactly what happened to me and this restaurant. I probably ate here with 3 different groups of friends and all ordered different menu items so I would like to think I got a good sense of the menu, while it is enormous in its own right. Think of this review as a crowdsourced review, because it is.The curries here need some work and maybe this is due to some Thai restaurants taking it easy on the spicy for particular customers, but I really felt like the curries were missing a few elements. Friends ordered the green curry and the massaman. As for the noodles, I didn't think the Pad Thai was super memorable. My friends ordered other noodles - one got the Drunken noodles, which was way too spicy and the other got the Pad see ew, which was too sweet. Vegan dishes are apparently very good according to my other friend. The Kao Soy and dessert dishes are very good according to myself."

The service is dissapponting and waiters were very rude. The pad thai noodles were too soft. I ordered fried fish with curry sauce and the curry sauce was so overpowered with ginger i couldnt taste the fish. Pork belly was overcooked and their chili sauce is watered down. Very disappointing! If you want authentic Thai food - go to Ayada.

Too much going on. I did not enjoy the combination of flavors for that particular dish.I also feel that the menu is way too big. It's a never ending notebook binder. Makes it too hard to make a decision. Service was decent and the prices are nice. I enjoyed the food for the most part. The soup once again was great. I would come back to eat again

We made the trek out to Woodside for this Thai restaurant for lunch. Their lunch special is a really good deal - $15.50 for an appetizer, soup, main, and drink. I got the Thai iced tea - it was already premixed when I got the drink so that's a bad sign. Taste like it was out of a can. Too sweet and not enough of the tea flavor. The tom yum soup was flavorful so that was a good start. Even though I asked for the papaya salad to be spicy, it wasn't that spicy and more sweet. The drunken noodle with ground pork was solid but nothing spectacular. Space is pretty big so you can definitely bring a stroller here. Service was good - they refilled our water a couple of times.Overall, great lunch special but probably not enough for me to make the trek out to Woodside for this Thai food."

The restaurant is pretty roomy and there's the garden area in the back that's really nice. The staff here are very friendly and they are great with kids. I always see lots of families eating here. The only complaint I have about this place is that they are cash only.  I don't know why they don't change that and start accepting credit cards. They would make so much more money.

Both meals were less than memorable and in my opinion, overpriced.  The drunken noodles were surprisingly too spicy although I had ordered a mild,  and the curries were boring and lacking in any real flavor.  Service was not very friendly, establishment is cash only and these are the additional factors which contribute to a low two star review.  If they lowered their prices and stepped up their service, it would have potential be a 3.5 star restaurant."

This is a great place especially to go for lunch and to get their Thai iced tea, appetizer, and main course special. If your threshold for spice is on the low side, you may be surprised at how spicy some of dishes are even if you ask for a more mild version. Sometimes they get it right and sometimes they don't. I would recommend getting the dishes the normal way they make them (especially if you have a high spice tolerance) because you couldn't expect them to taste the same if spice level is heavily modified."

The first few bites were manageable; but after about 1/4 of the way into the dish, the chilies kicked in.  Other than being spicy, there really wasn't anything special or memorable about the Drunken Noodles. It was also too salty. I was more bothered with the level of saltiness than anything else. However, I would come back and try something else off of their extensive menu."

I've dined here more than 5 times and have always been satisfied with the food. Dishes come out rather quickly and I'm always happy with the portion sizes. Other Thai restaurants I've been to have not been so generous. Friendliness of the staff is hit or miss, but it doesn't matter too much as long as I get my food. Relatively fast seating and fair prices."

Really close to the woodside lirr station and 7 train stop. I got my usual go-to thai food, the drunken noodle in the vegetarian option. The food was really good. The perfect amount of spice and the flavors were bursting in my mouth. As soon as we arrived we were seated right away. The restaurant was packed. Where we were seated was so tight so i legit had no room to move which was uncomfortable. After we ordered our food, the food came out in legit less than 10 minutes which was a major plus!! The portion size is decent. You leave not too stuffed or hungry and the prices for the entrees ranges starting at $10.00I will highly recommend and will defiantly be returning!"

Although there is some decent insight *I've been eyeing this place for a long time and never went until recently. A friend who lives in Long Island wanted to catch up over dinner. We needed a place close to the Woodside LIRR station so we picked this spot. As a vegetarian, I was happy that this place was vegetarian friendly. There is a yellow section of the menu that is specific to vegetarians - its a few pages - which is great. We ordered very light. I got the chive vegetable fried dumplings, Tom yum vegetarian soup and we shared a sticky coconut rice and mango dessert. The chive vegetable dumplings (About $4) are only filled with chive. Which was a let down as chive is a great addition to veggie dumplings (shout to Brooklyn Wok Shop!). It was way to ""doughy"" tasting. My fellow Vegetarians: Skip this appetizer! So this was my 1st time having Tom Yum soup. Turns out - It wasn't really my thing. But it wasn't bad @ all. It tasted sweet & spicy. It had flavor It's just, I didn't  know that I wasn't gonna become a fan of lemongrass. All in all, it was great to have a veggie version of a popular meat dish. It was also full of mushrooms, snow peas and other veggies. So it was definitely hearty. (Sm; about $4.50) i just only drank the broth tho so The dessert was delicious and unexpected. We weren't expecting sticky coconut rice w 2 big halves of mango and then the mango was on top of coconut milk that was dripping off of the sticky rice. It was a great combo! (Dessert; about $7) I also ordered a chardonnay ($5). It wasn't the best but what do you expect? It did the job. They don't have a happy hour but the drinks are cheap $4-10. Just don't ask the waiter - he has no idea what ""happy hour"" is. Kinda embarrassing on my part! Lol5 stars because of good service, ambience and the space is quite clean. Very well taken care of!Possible Dinner Party Location?I noticed that the place is not only well taken care of but it also has an extensive amount of space. Which lets me know that this restaurant would be a great party location. They were only using 1 dining room but had 2 available. This includes a beautifully maintained backyard dining area. They did a little ""landscaping"" and it looks really nice. I think there's even a fountain! I mean, you wouldn't even know they had a backyard from the outside. This place has big windows that let in a lot of light. Anyways, point is - if you're interested in having a dinner party - this is a cute spot. Last word: great romantic date night spot for under $35 for 2. That included tip!"

The food is so fresh and really authentic. Their drinks are also on point. I always get the same thing when I come here. Lots of options to choose from. Our waitress was poom and she was sweet and very attentive. Prices are great here as well. We usually pig out when we come here this time we took it easy. Vanilla Thai tea with stioli and a mango mojito hit the spot.  Bbq beef salad and crab and chicken rolls were also unreal. Honestly everything here tastes good lol. Go here. Won't be disappointed.

Be prepared for the menu! It is extensive and a little intimidating, but there are pictures and descriptions of everything and the wait staff give you plenty of time to look it over without rushing you. Once we ordered, the food came out surprisingly quick, which pleased me because I was starving and we had a toddler with us.We ordered the fried watercress salad (which is bomb, a must try), drunken noodles with sliced beef ( also excellent), fried tofu (yum) and fried pork belly (yum yum).

My wife and I hadn't had Thai food for many years and decided to celebrate an event by dining at a ""5"" star restaurant. We ordered an appetizer each and then decided upon our entree's. If one appetizer was inedible I would not be writing this now , but both appetizers were bland, tasteless and just , be gentle now, garbage. My wife's ordered a noodle entree and decided it was tasteless and requested that it be replaced with one that might have some flavor. Our ""waitress "" acquiesced and grudgingly put in my wife's new choice of entree.. unfortunately this too was inedible, as was mine ... we then decided that leaving our best option and we did have food at home.. upon receiving the check our waitress brought back the original entree in a bag and we were charged for three entrees , although we hadn't taken more than one fork full of each .. we mentioned that we should not be charged for the first entree and our waitress was adamant about leaving it on the bill. So in summation, if you have a free night and want bad food and snippy service.. you have found your nirvana. I have no idea what so ever how this eatery survives.. but don't buy the ""5"" star reviews.. fini!"

As a person that absolutely does not like Thai, this restaurant is awesome! Came here on the recommendation of a couple of friends and could not be happier we did.SriPraPhai Thai sits in perhaps the most unassuming corner of Woodside. You have your local barber shop, a few bodegas, an urban park, some bbq's and domino games, then--BAM amazing Thai restaurant!When you get to the restaurant, you'll likely have to wait so grab a number. They've got a DMV type system so you'll see your number on a large lotto like board in the windows. Efficiency here is high, you probably won't be waiting long and the place is also pretty big.SriPraPhai has an inside section and an outside section. Now that the weather is nice, I'd def recommend sitting outside. You'll walk through the inside and smell a bit of heaven. Walking through the threshold, you'll notice a wonderful water fountain. There's a fair amount of seating outside and each table has it's own (LED) overhead light above the table for when it gets dark.The menu--it's like a Thai bible. It's has enough pages to make Game of Thrones jealous. There are plenty of house drinks and beer as well as bountiful food options.Our table went with a number of dishes including: watercress salad, fried pork belly, drunken noodles, and a few soup dishes. They were all winners. Watercress salad is a must have. Full of flavor, it's crispy and delicious. The fried pork belly was my favorite of the selections. The drunken noodles were great and had the perfect amount of heat to them. I honestly wish I could describe the food in greater detail, but again, I don't like Thai food so this was all really a revelation.The service was fantastic. Our server was friendly, helpful and informative about the menu, and very eager to make sure we were enjoying the food and having a good experience.At the end of the meal, I expect--like us--you'll be blown away by how good this place is. It's not often I can give a place 5 stars, but here it is. More than worth going out of the way for."

We got our water & for drink, my bf got the iced coffee & I got the thai iced tea. It was too sweet & taste okay. For appetizer I got the papaya salad- the waiter suggested medium spicy so I agree. Its very sweet so I didn't really like that too much sweetness taste & its not spicy so I ask for a side of chili. My bf got calamari- so tiny but it taste good. For our dish I got the ground pork with chili & garlic over rice- the flavors & spiciness of the food is perfect! Very flavorful. My bf got pad thai- I tried it & it was dissapointing. Its very sweet & It doesn't really taste like pad thai. So he didn't really end up eating it. Overall, service is good! They're attentive. About the food I was not impressed. Whenever you think about thai restaurant you surely think about pad thai. How can that specific dish doesn't taste good. I don't think I'm returning."

The food is not that good. And the service is horrendous. Not to mention how expensive it is. There are so many better thai restaurants in the area. The meals don't come with rice.

My teacher recommended it to us but I never got around to trying it until 5 or 6 years later. My coworker also recommended it and since he was a foodie too, I trust that it had to be good. He gave me a list of recommendations to try out. I only managed to try a couple items because we weren't very hungry but they were all delicious. We had tried the Papaya Salad, which was spicy and tangy. It was also very refreshing to eat something light and tangy to rev up our appetites. We then ordered the Beef Tendon Soup Light, along with a couple bowls of coconut rice, because why go for regular when you can have coconut! The soup very flavor flavorful from the broth and the added cilantro for an extra punch in flavor. The beef tendon were also super tender that you barely even have to bite them! Even though this soup is so simple and light, it has a very homey feel to it, as if my mom made it for me. I could just eat this for days! I usually don't like soups when it comes to food outside because of the greasiness, but the soup here doesn't feel heavy at all (or at least this one doesn't). I'm not sure how the Dark version tastes like, but I am thinking it would have a more rich flavor in broth. The coconut rice was also really nice because it wasn't overly soft like some places. The coconut rice is also not as heavy as some, so if you like a lot of coconut milk in yours, this may not be for you. But even without being very heavy, it has nice fragrant coconut flavor to it.We also tried the BBQ Chicken which was less exciting because it was more like grilled chicken with two types of sauces, one which was more on the savory, while the other was sweet. The chicken was very moist, but flavor wise, it wasn't as exciting. I would definitely recommend this place if you want a larger range of choices when it comes to Thai food. If you want more than Pad Thai and Pad See Ew, this is definitely a place to go because their menu is quite large. If you do want the usual though, they definitely have Pad Thai and other noodle dishes that you see at a lot in other Thai restaurants. If you haven't tried SriPraPhai, just give it a try! I definitely want to go back and try out the dishes my coworker recommended. (Some dishes he recommended: papaya salad with dried shrimp, mango salad, thai buffalo wings, fried fish cake, beef noodle soup light, sour and spicy noodle soup, tom yum pork leg, stewed beef tendon, tom zap beef offal soup, soft shell crab, chicken over rice, pork tender, steam fish and sauteed crispy pork belly.)"

We ordered the red curry, somtum, Pad see ew, spice basil fried rice and some drinks. It does feel more authentic and the most similar to the thai food in Thailand. It's not as sweet which is good because thai American food is toned down a bit to meet the palate of Americans which done in a lot of thai restaurants in the city. However here not so much, which ends up being its plus point. Also, explains why it's very popular among Thai families! Will definitely be back here if I'm in the neighborhood!"

Back in the day the food was great and the service is good. Yesterday i went there with my husband, ordered pai thai, roasted pork over rice, chicken puff, Tom Yum Soup, and the dessert is sticky taro ball. First of all, Pai Thai is horrible there is no taste and the noodle is over cooked. All the noodle were stick together and soggy. Chicken puff is over fried, too tough and chewy to eat. Tom Yum soup is way over salted. And finally the dessert is the nightmare, it tastes sweet and salty at the same time. I asked our waiter right away why our dessert taste salty and sweet. The waiter replied ""i don't know"". Well, i asked if he can ask his other coworker or chef. And he kept on replied ""i don't know"" and just walk away. I look at him and i am liked seriously? However, few minutes later he came over and hand us the check. Btw, our waiter barely speak any english, sigh. I would not recommend anyone to try there food despite the high yelp review. Poor service, bad food, CASH Only."

Arrived on a summer Tuesday afternoon during their non-peak hours. My date and I wanted to go out to the garden to enjoy the surrounding flower but the server who greeted me warned that there will be lots of insects. Since it was really hot, we decided to stay inside. Interior is still spacious and can host parties of 20 or more. We ordered the duck salad (plenty of duck pieces but duck skin could be more crispier) which was refreshingly seasoned with lime and fish sauce.  They gave a generous amount of chicken pieces in my chicken pad Thai. The beef drunken noodle had a hint of sweetness and smokiness. My date said it taste as good as the one at Klong's (St. Marks, Manhattan). I was not fond of the coconut juice because it was overly sweet. Do they use real coconut juice? I am not sure. Menu is extensive. Servers are friendly and approachable. I will most likely come back to try more dishes. Hands down best Thai restaurant in NYC."

Or so I thought. 20 minutes passes by before I get the (non-cooked) salad, and it turns out to be the wrong one.  I decided to just go anyways with it since the regular version seems popular from reviews, but it's $10 for some slices of papaya, crushed peanuts, and a few small green beans. Another ten minutes passes by before the pad thai  comes - and this is all after we already had to wait a fairly long time to have our orders taken, despite being there only being two other tables.We didn't finish the pad thai and said we didn't want it packaged to go when asked - and of course, they packaged it for us to take to go. Which is fine, but it was pretty frustrating after also getting the wrong order.We also ordered dessert but it turns out they didn't have it, which is fine but just made the visit all the more underwhelming.Given the other reviews I'm really hoping my visit was an odd one out but aside from the friendly server, the mediocre food, high price point, and slow/poor service made for a fairly negative experience.

This place has awesome food especially the noodle dishes. Pad Thai and drunken noodles were and are the best I've had anywhere. The spicy dishes are legitimately spicy. Flavor was great for both noodle dishes and the noodles were cooked perfectly. The meat in the noodles was good - tender and tasty. This is a failing of many of the mc-thai restaurants popping up in many suburban towns where the meat in the noodle dishes is rough and flavorless. Appetizers were not as good as the entrees. The papaya salad was very flavorful but way too salty. I had to be ""that jerk"" to ask them to take it back to the kitchen and make it less salty (and spit in). It came back just as salty. The mushroom shrimp soup was overly salty too and not worth the price tag imo based on the simple taste and the modest portion. Just try out another delicious entree instead for a few bucks more."

Don't see what the hype is about. Just like most east coast Thai restaurants the food is too sweet. They do this for Farang. Also the availability of proper agriculture in this region of the USA shows. In California we have Thai farms. If the food wasn't so sweet it would be much better. Definitely overrated.

I've been here a few times, and I will say the fish entrees are the best things on this menu. This time around I opted for crispy noodles, curry puffs, Tom yum soup. The noodles were how I expected, not in your face with flavor but not bland where I would drop fish sauce and whatever condiments that will make it salty. The curry puffs were on the sweet side for me, which is something I noticed when I was over there (things are sweeter in the motherland). Tom yum is Tom yum.What is my take away this time around?

Noodles were nice and a bit bouncy. The flavor though. . It's missing something. Flavor was flat. I've had better. - Thai iced tea:   Two thumbs up! Highly recommended!

The server suggested that we order as soon as possible so that we wouldn't have to wait too long for our food. The menu is HUGE! So many choices, I was honestly overwhelmed.Appetizers: Calamari- They were flavorful and crunchy.Vegetarian Curry Puffs- These were also good but there was too much corn in each.Entrees:Drunken Noodles- This was so spicy, my dad (a man who eats raw peppers) couldn't finish it. However, I ate it the day after and the spiciness did calm down. If you get this, don't say you want it ""thai"" spicy.Fried Rice with Chili Sauce- If you enjoy a sweet dish, this is the one for you. The green beans on the side were lightly steamed which, i did not enjoy.Roasted duck over rice- My mom enjoyed this, she said the duck wasn't as chunky as it should be but it was good.There's also a vegetarian menu, my sister got the fried tofu- she said this was spicy but very flavorful!

I've been meaning to come here forever because I heard this is one of the best thai foods in town. We came on a Thursday night and it was not that busy. The best dish of the night was actually the fried watercress. The sauce that it came with was phenomenal and it came with many plump shrimps. However, there were more cons than pros based on my experience. Strike 1: I was really disappointed when we couldn't get outdoor seating (which is gorgeous..opt for it if you can get a chance). Strike 2: The Masaman curry was pathetic. It came with 2 small pieces of chicken and the rest was just potatoes. Strike 3: The drunken noodles were not flavorful at all and it tasted more like chinese take out chow fun. It lacked a lot of the thai spice. Strike 4: The soft shell crabs (which was the main dish I wanted to try here) was EXTREMELY SALTY and the fish sauce overpowered the dish. Strike 5: The coconut ice cream looked 100x better than it tasted. I wasn't a fan of the peanuts on top."

The meat itself is so tender, but the outside is nice and crispy, and the contrast is so nice. The spicy and sour dipping sauce is so good also, I love love love this dish so much, a must try.I really like the beef tendon soup also. They are super generous with the tendon - it's perfectly cooked with an amazing bite to it, and the soup is nice also. I always get the regular one (never tried the dark).The crabmeat fried rice was a little disappointing. Again, they are VERY generous with the crab meat, but I wish the rice was a bit crispier. The soft rice and crab have almost the same texture so it didn't really have that nice mouth feel you would get at a good Chinese restaurant fried rice. I also think they could be a little more aggressive with the seasoning- they probably don't want to overpower the sweetness of the crab but it was a tad bit bland.The pad Thai is usually quite good, but today it was a bit on the sweet side for me. Generous with the shrimp also, and the peanuts and lime are a nice touch. We also tried the BBQ chicken with coconut rice set, and it also comes with some papaya salad. The papaya salad here is pretty good- it's nice and sweet, sour, and tangy. The BBQ chicken was nothing special really, but at least it was well cooked. Interestingly the coconut rice here is sweet! My first time having coconut rice ever I expected it to be sweet, but it seems that in Malaysian cuisine the coconut rice is more savory, and the coconut is more for the aroma. However, the coconut takes the driver seat, and it was pleasantly sweet. The rice was nice and fluffy, but they provided a sweet dipping sauce for the chicken, so I'm not really sure how I feel about the sweet on sweet.The appetizer plate is just alright. The chicken wings aren't bad but the tofu is pretty boring. The brocolli with pork belly is so good (and I don't even like vegetables lol). The sauce is great, and I love the fact there's crispy pork belly in the vegetables. I am not a fan of the Thai iced tea here. It's way too sweet for my liking and there isn't much of a tea flavor because of the overwhelming sweetness. I've tried a few of the desserts in the past but I was not particularly impressed.Service here is pretty prompt and the food doesn't take too long to come out. The restaurant gets pretty packed on Fridays and weekends so there might be a bit of a wait. The menu is gigantic and a bit overwhelming. But overall awesome and authentic Thai food. Super cool toilets also :)"

Chicken pad thai didn't have much taste to it and we ordered another flat noodle which also was tasteless. Only thing I liked was the thai iced tea.

I have not been to this place in 15 years. It is certainly a lot fancier then I remember. I came here last night for date night with the wife. We had three healthy sized apps, the green papaya salad. It was just as it should be. A  hot / cooling sensation running thru my mouth full speed. First dark lao down and wife's lychee martini. Then came the fried watercress salad. I was apprehensive on ordering this one knowing my wifes love for fried anything, not! This dish was devilishly good. The larb was larb a awesome dish of heat,meat and lime. Third lao and second lychee down. Wife returns to the watercress to keep the heat at bay. Now I did ask for thai hot and it was. I wish I sat with a party of 50 so I could have tasted everything.

The soups were quite impressive, and the lunch deal was appropriately priced ($14 - you may need to request the menu).  I wouldn't cross town to visit again, though I'd stop in locally for sure."

This is a disgrace to anyone who knows Thai food well.No self respecting Thai food lover would approve the crispy Trout Fillet in Spicy Curry Sauce that was served to me last night. It was not spicy at all and I had to request for the spices on the side to give it a kick. This used to be my favorite Thai restaurant but the inconsistency showed in getting the spice level right is just too much.Coupled with the fact that my favorite server and the only one I trusted to get my order right - the one known as ""Bella"" is no longer there.

The place looks very down to earth. The uses of the brown color gives the place a natural look. Since the weather agreed with us, we decided to sit outdoors. The staff opened the sun umbrellas. That made it feel more comfortable. For the appetizers, we ordered the fried wheat seitan. I ordered the Drunken Noodle with vegetables. Delicious.

Ever. My parents agree. Thank you to Fazeela S. for the recommendation.We came on a rainy, windy, cold Thursday night and SriPraPhai still had a full house! Impressive.I was thoroughly pleased with everything I tried. The coconut chicken soup was so delicious and so flavorful. I'm still amazed. Chicken curry puffs - this standard Thai appetizer was so good, fresh, and piping hot. The red curry (we requested no fish sauce because of my allergies) was spicy but good! I can't handle spice too well but my parents really enjoyed this. We also had an order of the roasted duck and pad see-ew with pork. Everything was unbelievable.The menu is huge and very overwhelming. If you have trouble making decisions or aren't familiar with Thai food, you might have some trouble figuring out what to order. Regardless, they have everything!ALSO, they are very accommodating for customers with food allergies and there is a separate vegetarian menu. These people thought of everything!Service was kind of slow but not for lack of trying. They were just very, very busy. Those servers were always on the move. Very polite, accommodating, and we had an overall great time.SriPraPhai is also relatively inexpensive (as most Thai restaurants are) compared to others that serve food of this quality. We ordered 1 appetizer, 2 soups, 3 entrees, 2 sides of rice, 3 cocktails, and 2 desserts and the bill was ~$95 (and we had leftovers to bring home).Drawbacks: cash only and they do not take reservations. But the food is beyond worth the small hassle.Thai is not my cuisine of choice. That being said, this is the ONLY Thai restaurant that I will happily go to or even suggest knowing I will enjoy the food. Do it!"

The portion sizes are standard you won't leave hungry. The service can be a little slow due to the high demand of people coming and going.

This place can serve pretty authentic Thai food but you really have to know what to order. Not everything is a win in this place. I came with Marco and we ordered the raw shrimp, the roasted duck on rice, the crispy ground catfish and the thai sausage. The raw shrimp hands down was the best thing. Amazing. I'd go back to this place just to order this. It's really outstanding. The roasted duck isn't bad but not great. The ground catfish is a waste. I've never had ground catfish so wasn't sure what to expect. It's like a hard powder that really has no taste. The sausage was solid though, would order this again. Next to the raw shrimp was a small order of mango salad which was really good also. So overall, I'd come back to try other things but I really think you have to order the right things off the menu."

Whenever we wanted *real* Thai, and had time to make a hike to Queens, we never hesitated to spend the time. I always recommended it to everyone as the best thai in NYC . It was always sooo good. But something has changed. Over the last year, visited the place twice and both of the times were very mediocre experiences. Just this weekend, we went back and had 4 dishes. Only one of them came out decent, as in approaching to what it USED to be. The rest was just bleeeh . Wheres before each dish would be a revelation, now i can't stop and think that I could do better at any takeout. I asked that has been there for many years if something has changed? No, she assured me, the chef is  still the same. I don't buy it. Also, i couldn't help but notice that the restaurant is having hard time filling seats. So i think lots of  people have noticed the deterioration of quality. On Saturday night the restaurant was half empty. The adjacent sessions - which they built in the last year or so was completely empty.  In the past, there used to be a line out of the door with half an hour wait."

Finally by chance on a beautiful Saturday morning I was nearby for a test drive earlier that I've finally get a chance to try this place for some takeouts before heading home. Although I didn't dine in, looking at the interior it did seem quite modern and more updated than I would expect from a traditional Thai place, the place has been doing very well with the help of these glowing yelp reviews no doubt. I arrived shortly after 12pm where it wasn't as quite packed yet, but after about 10-15 minute of walking around the neighborhood while waiting for my order when I stepped in it was a totally different situation where I didn't see one single table empty. Like anything popular in NYC the earlier you go the less you have to wait.Anyway onto the food, I've tried Ka Soy and as well as Massaman Curry a dish that I almost always get at a new Thai restaurant. Ka Soy was a first for me especially since they packed it separately I thought the broth is more of a dipping sauce than soup haha. But while the broth was really creamy and flavor I think was really salty if I drink it straight as soup. Definitely a very enjoyable dish. The Massaman Curry is really one of the best I've had and that's after it was sitting in my car for almost an hour for my trip back home. The chicken was really tender and large cut while the sauce is very creamy. I've no doubt its probably filled with oil and salt but man it was very delicious. A little disappointed that rice wasn't included by default but glad I had backup rice already made at home.Their desserts are amazing as well. I tried both the Taro Custard Cake and their deep fried taro bread and both were phenomenal. I would certainly go with the fried taro as that was freshly done and the breading was very crunchy and filled with sesame seeds.I think the price was a really good selling point for this restaurant as well. Although its cash only but at $10 a dish it's certainly cheaper than many of other Thai restaurants with similar offering. Definitely a 5 star place for the food and price alone being I didn't have to wait and didn't really have to experience their dine in service. It doesn't really need another glowing 5 star review but honestly this is one of the times that something so well reviewed lived up to the expectations."

I was expecting a bit more effort put into the ambiance, food presentation, taste, or dining service to justify the slightly higher prices, but all you really get is a bit more square footage, back patio, and bathrooms that don't double as mop storage. Ordered drunken noodles ""spicy"" and they might have a bit of a kick but I was certainly not sweating or hurting. They have a ""very spicy"" which may have acually been what I expected. Nice cooler full of prepackaged takeaway desserts. Probably a good bet for a first date because it's near the subway and there's nothing really remarkable to distract from getting to know each other.

They have a very large outdoor back patio that got very busy for Saturday lunch. From the front it's very misleading about how many people they could serve. They were also selling premade dishes from a fridge when you walk in; I didn't get, but good to know for those late night cravings/lazy nights."

My. God.  I'm going to zoom right past the food and just say yes it is good.  But the mango sticky rice.  The five stars are based solely on the sticky rice (service was meh and food was just good). If you order nothing else, order the mango sticky rice. It is sweet and savory and melts in your mouth. It is so well balanced. It has this surprising little salty element that really puts it over the top.

Within seconds of walking in, I noticed a terrible smell that reminded me of a mix of bad breath and sweaty socks. I was hoping that the smell was coming from a person but when I took a walk to the back of the restaurant, the smell lingered throughout. 1 of us got a beef dish and 4 us got pad Thai. 2 chicken, 1 shrimp and I got beef. We got some appetizers for the table including a spicy beef dish, fried crab ball, veg roll, soup and chicken wings. 2 people ordered drinks. The pad Thai had some kind of strange flavor that I couldn't put my finger on but I didn't really like it. The spicy beef smelled like feet and (even though we ate it) we had to throw a napkin over it and push it aside. I didn't try the rest of the stuff but my friends said they enjoyed their meal. The best part about the meal was the price and portion size. We spent $150 for 5 people and 2 of us took food home. I've heard a lot of good things about this place so I would try it again. Hopefully next time the smell will be gone."

We got there probably 15 minutes before close and it was packed. People were still coming in and they were still seating until 9:30pm when they closed. Even though they were about to close, they never once made us feel rushed. They went about cleaning the other tables as patrons got up to leave without making us feel as though they wanted us out. They sat us at a table and were told to order cause the kitchen was about to close - but they gave me plenty of time to pick some pretty good dishes and get recommendations from the server. Plenty of servers on hand to take care of water glasses and napkin requests. The food was just as good as I have had at other Thai restaurants. Pretty authentic with the heat so be mindful of those in your party, when you tell them you want original Thai spice. Oops! I loved it though! :PI could have eaten the entire plate of the Basil Fried Rice with beef. Wasn't in love with the Northern Thai sausage but it had a really nice heat to it. The Thai Iced tea was also too sweet for me. But I don't think you can go wrong with most of the dishes here. I appreciated their ability to serve us and at the same time let us know that it was closing. We didn't overstay our welcome and ate and left when we were done but it was still a relaxing and great meal."

After finally having authentic Thai from Somtum Der and Sripraphai, Thai food has definitely risen to the ranks of one of my favorite cuisines. We went on a Saturday around 7:30pm and there was no wait to be seated in the inside and only a 20 minute wait to be seated outside in the back garden. I enjoyed the garden area on a beautiful August day, where it wasn't too hot or humid. The servers were extremely friendly, very attentive (never an empty water glass), and helpful when recommending what to order. Here's what we ordered:- Fried Softshell Crab with Green Curry ($19) - My favorite of the night! A little pricey for two softshell crabs, but they're expensive everywhere. The crabs were fried perfectly, thin layer of batter, crispy crunch, piping hot when it arrived at the table. Devoured immediately. Pull it apart and dunk it in the green curry, the crab stays crisp but has a great added flavor with the curry. Buy some coconut rice to go with the rest of the curry or just eat it by the spoonful like we did! - Pad Thai with Shrimp ($10) - I don't care if pad thai isn't authentic. The flavor combinations work perfectly well together. Sour from the tamarind paste, sweet from the palm sugar, salty from the fish sauce, with a touch of brightness from a squeeze of lime! I love it. It's delicious. The noodles made here are still springy even while the sauce clings to it. You only get 6 shrimps... but it's more than what other places give you so I'm not complaining. - Mango Salad with Seafood ($11.50) - I really liked this. I opted for this instead of the papaya salad and I'm glad I did. The mango julienne strips held up well with the marinade, a little spicy, a little sour, all over tasty. Lots of seafood too. A little odd with the added chicken pieces but didn't take anything away from the overall dish.I can't wait to come back! Looking forward to trying the fried pork belly with chilis and basil and the fried whole snapper!! I saw the snapper on other people's tables and my mouth was drooling."

We got to try out the lunch special where you choose from 3 different categories: appetizer, soup, entree, and  beverage for a set price of $14.95. We started off with the chicken & shrimp dumpling and the papaya salad. The dumplings were a little below average. It had a funny texture to it. The papaya salad was pretty refreshing but got a little too spicy for my taste. For the soup, I got to try the cocounut chicken soup & the Tom Yum shrimp soup. Both were amazing. You could really taste the coconut and the curry in the soup. It blended pretty well together. The tom yum soup was also very good. The soup came with two shrimps in it. Our main entree was the Red Curry with Rice & the drunken noodle with chicken. Both were excellent and very tasty. The noodles were cooked pretty well, which could make it or break with this dish. The red curry was delicious, especially with the bamboo and the chicken in it.Overall, fast service, great food, and excellent price for lunch. Highly recommended spot."

I was a bit surprised of the lack of wait, given the hype this place has.We over-ordered and went with the following:Basic papaya salad - mmm, this was good.  The papaya had the perfect crunch to it and it was well marinated and very flavorful.  Love the dried shrimp - most ""un-authentic"" Thai places forget to put in the dried shrimp, and that stuff is critical.Shrimp tom yum soup (large) - not really that large, to be honest.  It was a bit too tangy and sweet and tasted somewhat artificial.  Not sure how to explain it, but I've had better tom yum soup back home in the suburbs of Atlanta.  Shrimp was tender and the mushrooms were good, but did not like the soup base very much.Calamari pad gra prow (basil sauce) - extra $1.50 for squid.  Came with plenty of squid, lots of basil, and plenty of red bell peppers.  Flavor was alright, but as I've said, nothing really different or better than any Thai place I've had in the city.Drunken noodles (sliced beef) - you have the option of ground or sliced.  The sliced beef was tender and juicy, but there wasn't much of it.  Noodles were yum as usual, but not much to it for this dish.  Comparable to other places.Rice is an additional $1 a bowl.Not sure if SriPraPhai is SO good that I would make my way out to Woodside from the city again, but it was a decently satisfying meal.  I think I still prefer Pure Thai Cookhouse in the city."

Definitely worth it if you need to order only one dish.Other items: shrimp salad (standard), beef penang curry (very tender), chicken stock ride (must have), and sticky rice.I'd forego ordering Thai iced tea since the glass they serve it in is small for the price you pay."

I ordered the beef tendon soup (3.5/5), beef red curry (2.5/5 in taste, but also side note that you have to order rice separately...) and shrimp drunken noodles (4/5).

Since it's expanded (and consumed the surrounding two spaces) it has become a Thai ""mecca"" serving mass produced food. Of course, those who are just familiar with the basics (pad thai, som tum, etc) may be satisfied, but they didn't even get that right for me the last time I was here. The pad see ew I ordered (in Thai, etc.) came so sweet and dry that it was just irreparable - even with all the side condiments (that came in to-go jars?). WTF happened?? Where did the authenticity go? It certainly didn't go to Northern Boulevard. It's as if the chef either didn't taste the food going out. Or, the chef doesn't know how it's supposed to taste.

The noodles were great, especially as a late night option, and the papaya salad,with it's crunch and strong flavors, was one my favorites, and I am far from a salad crunching gal. The chicken saté was perfection with the peanut sauce, and I'd be remiss if I didn't mention that one vegetarian guy in the group *cough* *Charles* ate the chicken and didn't know it was chicken! Naturally that merited one hell of a roasting. There wasn't a single thing I tried that I didn't like, everything had texture and flavor and at a great  price! Now I just need to go back and try all their drinks."

I wish I could reach into my fridge right then to get my Sweet Chilli sauce instead of this horrible one they gave. Shrimp pad Thai was way over cooked in water and was too soft. Green curry soft shell crab tasted like popcorn chicken from Popeyes'.  Way too much breading which overtook the Crabmeat and it was lost in.  The curry sauce was good for my rice though. Roasted duck in curry sauce (with bamboo shoots and eggplant) was disgusting. It was very salty and the sauce was beyond horrible.   I wish I sent this back to the kitchen cause how can they serve this?  What a waste of duck when duck is such a delicious meat. We were in shock the place was so busy even the food was so bad.  We've been eating Thai food for over 20 years (most of them in Manhattan) and this place is not recommended."

Tucked away is this rustic Cuban restaurant serving up delicious food and a cool island vibe with its photos and memorabilia of Cuba on the walls. It is not an upscale place but it is warm and inviting with an atmosphere perfect for a cozy dinner with that special someone or family. I ordered the red sangria and jupina both equally delicious but who doesn't love sangria so I would opt for that next time I visit . We ordered the fried green plantains, rice and beans cooked with bacon, roasted pork and of course their famous Cuban sandwich with a side of drench fries. Let's start off with those rice and beans .... could I have a whole pot of those to go ? So delicious so flavorful .... I couldn't get enough of it and paired with the roasted pork covered in their garlic sauce it was bliss in every bite . The fried green bananas also amazing and super crunchy.their Cuban sandwich really is delicious I truly enjoyed the fact that there was a good bread to filling ratio and that the bread was nicely toasted and super crunchy. My only issue were the fries being a little too oily. Overall an amazing culinary experience and i will definitely be back for more of that rice and beans !"

That would be a loss on your part. Situated right next to a bakery with bright fruit colored cakes, RC's signage is a bit faded and incognito.Old school red and white checkered table tops, RC is comfortably dated and well worn, with minute service. By the looks of the clientele this Cuban hotspot was a regulars kind of place. Thumbs up.We had some trouble deciding but their special app of the night sounded wonderful: tostones topped with ropa vieja and ground meat. All the items were in Spanish and English but we found the names to provide little clarity as to what was in each meat dish. The first guy they gave us was confident and cordial but because we were indecisive they gave us Esther who was amazing. We opted for a stuffed cassava starter and grilled skirt steak with onions and oxtail (Rabo encendido). That cassava was burn the roof of your mouth hot and delicious. Think silky smooth mashed potato that's a bit sweet folded into ground beef, shaped into a burrito and deep fried. That crust was something else and you eat this with Tabasco apparently. I can dig that. The skirt steak was juicy and flavorful on its own topped with rings of seared onions. The oxtail was fatty and fall of the bone tenderness in a tomatoey stew. All served with rice and beans and maduros. Proportioned perfectly just like Esther said, we ate every morsel and left nothing to waste.The dishes are not blow my mind flavor bombs, but reminiscent of mom's kitchen. Something someone has cooked a million times to know the right cut, pressure and time to let the ingredient shine by itself. When I asked Esther if the Oxtail sauce is the same as the famed Ropa Vieja, she said no. They are both red but different. The sweet girl even brought over a little sample of their RV for us: rich and brothy with definitely more tang, it was really good and we can see why it's a bestseller. My only gripe is that we didn't have room for dessert but we will be back."

Even though I felt it was delicious I was still afraid of what this Miami Cuban would say. Well he told me it was the best Cuban food he'd ever had in the tristate area. Furthermore he said he hadn't had Cuban food this good since his his grandmother cooked for him many years ago! PERIOD!!!

Before walking in, I expected the restaurant to be small, however, after opening the door and taking a few steps in, I was surprised at how big it actually is. The decor and ambience of the restaurant is culturally rich, nothing lacking of Cuban culture. The menu is very easy to understand, they have the dishes in Spanish with English translations. Each entree comes with two sides. We had an order of the 1/2 roasted chicken and chicken breasts with green peppers and onions. We had side orders of rice, black beans and tostones. The garlic sauce that came with the tostones wasn't strong or pungent in my opinion, I would've enjoyed it a bit more if it were stronger. Their dishes were delicious, I found the 1/2 chicken to be a bit dry but it fared well with the beans and rice. The dishes are small but enough to share a few bites around the tables. A cup of coffee is the perfect nightcap to you meal. It's strong but perfectly brewed. Might I also mention, the dishes are fairly priced, cheaper than your average Cuban spot. The only downside of my experience is that I was looking forward to a garlic of homemade green sauce to compliment my dish, however the only sort of hot sauce they had was Tabasco, eh. Nonetheless, great experience, I'd visit again."

What's more surprising is that this place has amazing reviews which totally deceived me. I can really only speak for the seafood paella since my friend and I shared that as our main dish. 1st of all, it takes an HOUR to make which they tell you ahead of time, so that's fine since we had an appetizer (which was delicious- the only good thing here) and wine. However, when you order an hour long paella at $52 for the dish, you expect AMAZING paella. Not mediocre, not bad, but amazing! Sadly, this was the most tasteless, overcooked paella I have ever had in my life. It had NO flavor. The seafood inside was cooked dry. The lobster meat and shrimp was tough and didn't have flavor. The scallops were soft but almost too soft as if they didn't cook at all. Horrible ! My friend and I added salt, pepper and hot sauce onto it which we typically would never do to a restaurant made dish cuz it's usually always flavorful, if not beyond ! This was crazy ! What's worse is that we mentioned this TWICE to the workers- one who brought it out from the kitchen and one who's our waitress. We mentioned it in the beginning before we even really touched it. the first guy who served it to us just smiled and laughed nervously.  Didn't say or offer anything. The second time, we mentioned it to the waitress and she said ""oh no !! Really ?? No one's said that to us before... I'm so sorry"" which was MUCH nicer than what the other guy did. However, she didn't offer much at all either except for spices in the back kitchen.... seriously ?! - no refund, no half price, no dessert on the house or ANYTHING to make up for the horrible paella - and mind you, this paella was $52 dollars- RIDICULOUS for something that tastes so bad. Yes, the portion is huge and can feed 4 instead of 2, but I don't ever wanna pay so much money for something that tasted like nothing. I don't mind paying a lot for good food - excellent food I might add, but paying a lot for bad food and horrible customer service? No thanks. Lastly, I'm not sure why this isn't mentioned on yelp enough but this is a CASH BASED restaurants. CASH OR AMEX only. When you charge a single item that's over $50, how can you only accept cash and Amex ?? I've eaten at many cash based restaurants, but they're smaller restaurants and wayyy cheaper meals, so it's understandable that they only accept cash. We almost didn't even have enough but it was enough to cover the check and give them a very low tip - and to be honest, that's all this restaurant really deserved, if any at all.  There are only 2 good things about this restaurant: the wine and this appetizer where they had ropa Veja and ground beef on top. The ropa veja was very good- better than other Cuban restaurants I've been at. And as for the wine, it's $6-8 for a very full glass which is great. But honestly, besides those two things, this was a pretty horrible restaurant and establishment. Truly disappointed and will not be returning"

Great authentic Cuban food spot. I've gone here a few times and gotten the Cuban sandwich which hits the spot and the ropa vieja which is some of the best I've had.

We asked for them to split the bill and our awesome server was about to help us when she abruptly interrupted our conversation, she then proceeded to split our bill in two which uh duh we could've done ourselves. They only take AMEX and cash so bring cash or you'll pay a $3.00 convenience fee to use their ATM machine.  The worst part about this whole situation was when we gave our waiter the money to pay for our bill she took it from his hands. I just hope he gets his tip because he deserves it.  Voy a darle a este lugar 3 estrellas solo en función de mi experiencia como cliente. La comida es excelente y nuestro servidor fue increíble. Nuestra mala experiencia fue con Ester, no sé si era gerente o anfitriona, pero maldita sea, su actitud era horrible y ademas condescendiente. Pedimos  que dividieran  la factura y nuestro increíble servidor estaba a punto de ayudarnos cuando ella interrumpió abruptamente nuestra conversación, luego procedió a dividir nuestra factura en dos, lo cual podríamos haber hecho nosotros mismos.Solo aceptan AMEX y efectivo, así que traiga efectivo o pagará una tarifa de conveniencia de $ 3.00 para usar su cajero automático. La peor parte de toda esta situación fue cuando le dimos a nuestro camarero el dinero para pagar nuestra factura, ella le quitó el dinero de las manos de una manera irrespetuosa.

I loved the vaca frita (fried shredded beef) and the mariquitas (plantain chips) with that heavenly and pungent garlic sauce on the side. OMG. The service was fun and efficient the whole time.

I would order again though because it tasted very good. The shrimp in Spanish sauce... oh boy this was phenomenal. I took that sauce and started putting it on everything. The best combo was the Spanish sauce with the Moro rice. Oh man my taste buds were dancing. The shrimp was so tender as well and huge. This would be my go to fish for sureeee. Service was impeccable. The water glass was always full. Lovely. Their sangria was very good, not too sweet but filled with rich red wine flavor. Yummm"

I found out that several of my friends on Yelp, including the revered Mister Dessert himself, had rated this restaurant very highly, so I was ready to be delighted. And delighted I was. Ropa vieja (a classic Cuban dish of shredded beef in a savory sauce) is always my first choice at any Cuban restaurant. The creative name of the dish literally translates to ""old clothes"" due to its appearance (with intertwined shreds of beef), which somebody with a vivid imagination apparently thought bore a resemblance to rags. Rincon Criollo's version of ropa vieja, cooked in an onion and tomato based sauce, is the best I've ever had (including the ones I've had at Cuban restaurants in Miami and Puerto Rico). The tenderness and flavor of this dish are outstanding. When you go to this restaurant, you can pretend to peruse the menu in detail, feigning an interest in other dishes, and then just order the ropa vieja. OK, if you get the vaca frita (another dish of shredded beef but cooked dry rather than in a sauce) instead of the ropa vieja on one of your visits, I will not judge you too harshly. Cuban desserts tend to be a little too sweet, so you might not be able to finish your cascos de guayaba or dulce de leche cortada (caramelized and curdled milk), but don't let that deter you from trying these fantastic desserts."

One of my friends raved about this place for so long so i wanted to give it a try and the reviews we're great.I came here on a Friday night and was seated right away. I ordered the ropa vieja which is classic Cuban dish with a side of sweet bananas. Right of the jump the ropa vieja was nothing special and was lacking that authentic Cuban flavor. I've been to a lot of great cuban spots in Miami as well as other places so i know authentic Cuban. THIS was far from it and something you can get at a bodega. Service was great and the ambiance and decor was cool. I would def come back and try something different that i might enjoy. Overall this place is decent and in my opinion the Cabana has way better food in forest hills. People make a big deal out of places and over exaggerate especially when people like Guy Fierri visited this resteraunt on triple D to eat. Also real cubans who were raised on eating cuban food a vouch that this place ain't nothing special. The Bronx got way better Cuban restaurants in my opinion.DON'T BE FOOLED BY THE REVIEWS..... this place ain't trash but highly overrated by Americans that don't know authentic Cuban food.

We got the breaded chicken breasts which were golden delicate and perfectly seasoned and the ropa vieja. This classic dish was sublime, full of saucy earthy soul. The rice and beans couldn't have been better, so aromatic and homemade tasting. I'm far from a cuban food expert but I think these folks know what they are doing."

Don't worry, it happens to the best of us. Figured a safe bet, a standard, a staple... was the ropa vieja. Not this time. Sort of rubbery, a bit on the sweeter side and a very slightly reminiscent taste of a ketchup imposter. Someone else at our table ordered an avocado salad as his main dish. MAIN. Dish. It was basically the same side salad I got with my meal,(iceberg lettuce with a few slices of tomato), BUT with an additional 4 chunks of avocado. And not a whole, quartered avocado. I actually thought he had ordered avocado ON his side salad. Get it? It's a little weird. I'm just not comprehending the 700+ reviews and an overall 4.5 star, stellar review rating.The service was good & the tostones were the highlight at just above mediocre. End of story.

Fast forward a year and I'm finally here! Yay for procrastination! So when we get there a really upbeat and welcoming guy seats us at a 2 seat table. The guy saw me fumbling trying to take off everything and suggested we move to a table with 4 seats. WHAT A SWEETHEART. So we're mindlessly looking over the menu and he stops by again. Asks if we want any drinks and gives his pitch for the shakes they make in house. I was sold and got the mango one. One glance at me and he says ""no pork?"" I nod and he suggested the ""stuffed cassava."" Made with ground beef I was told. We do the rice and chicken pot and my friend gets the side of plantain chips. First comes out the complimentary bread, my shake. That shake was SO GUUUUUUUUUD. I could feel the bits of pulp in the drink. It was sweet and really flavorful. Nice pairing with the rest of the food. Her plantain chips I kept munching as though it was bottomless. The stuffed cassava was really good. It had a soft fluffy exterior. Filled with potatoes and ground beef. Fluffy pocket of food. PEOPLE DO NOT GET THE CHICKEN AND RICE DISH WITHOUT A MINIMUM OF 3 PEOPLE. So you know how on the menu it says ""pot for 2?"" That is a SUGGESTION. That pot was massive. It's made to order so you wait an hour for it. It literally came out in a massive pot! I took two plateful and had to tap out. My friend was a trooper and kept going. Now about service, our waiter was really peppy and engaging. He stopped by numerous times to check up on us, recommended both the shake and appetizer, also when the piping hot came out, he fixed our plates so we wouldn't be hit with that steam. But you know what makes this special? While he was waiting on other tables, I glanced up and noticed he has a limp. At first I thought I was mistaken. But no, I kept my eye on him and certainly the sweet man has a limp on his leg. He provided service above and beyond. Not once would I have known about his limp if I didn't see it myself. We tipped well and left the restaurant with smiles from the entire staff. While the food isn't spicy it is really flavorful and the staff is spectacular. You will have a wonderful time."

We were craving some Latin flavors and landed on Cuban. This was a nice in between spot for those of us who life in the Forest Hills/Kew Gardens area and those who live in Astoria. When we entered we were missing someone in a party, butt they told us we can sit down anyway and wait. This was greatly appreciated as it was snowing, and some restaurants are strict about waiting for the entire party before seating. The menu was large and there were so many options. We may have gone a bit over board. I ordered the leech on asado with a side of the black rice and beans and sweet plantains. My husband got the sautéed chicken with onions and peppers with white rice and French fries. Then he ordered a Spanish omelette just cuz! We also ordered some yuca boiled in garlic sauce for the table. The wait staff was very attentive and informative as we waited for our food. They checked in often. Once we got out food.... silence. It was sooo good! I ate way more than I intended, but it was so hard to stop. The portions were more than generous! I was shocked that the 2 sides that accompany the meal were so large. We could barely fit all the food on our table. While my husband's chicken sounded plain, it wasn't. It came in a flavorful sauce that livened up the white rice. As I'm writing this review, I'm just wanting to go back for more. We ended the meal with a tres leches, because how can you not. It was delicious. For 4 of us, we ended up paying $30 after tax and tip. We were amazed because we ordered quite a lot. This includes sodas, a glass of wine, and some coffees. The atmosphere was so homey and family oriented. A nearby table had a family of about 14-16. They ordered the arroz con pollo in a pot. It literally came out in a large kitchen pot and smelled amazing! I will have to try this next time. Well not a whole pot, but that arroz con pollo seemed on point. Needless to say, we'll be returning. This is a solid Cuban spot. Also saying this after visiting Miami and being severely disappointed with the Cuban food I tried there. NY, NY!"

They are most famous for their half fried chicken with garlic sauce but their side dishes (rice & beans and sweet plantains) were wonderful as well. After an event in Corona, I decided to take my family and friends here so they could share my experience. We were seated promptly and soon after the waiter took our order. We were all excited for the food especially since I hyped it up so much in the past. However, here is where things went downhill. After about half an hour we received our first appetizer (chorizo) and then we had to wait another 30 minutes for the next dish to come out. In between all that waiting, I looked around and saw that every table had a basket of bread except for our table. Now, to be fair, we ordered a seafood paella for the table and the waiter warned us that it would take an hour to cook, which was fine. However, we thought that it was common sense to bring out the other foods that we ordered first and then paella last rather than waiting a full hour for all the food to arrive. Nonetheless, we received all our food at the same time. We ordered two half friend chicken with garlic sauce which was good as always, grouper with garlic sauce, sides of salad, sweet plantain, rice & beans, and ropa vieja. All in all, the food was okay. I excepted a little better given how much I loved the fried chicken with garlic sauce but other dishes, especially the paella, didn't stand out to me. The paella was a little on the bland side and very wet almost to a porridge consistency. Would I go back? of course but only for their amazing fried chicken with garlic sauce."

It's a place that has gotten rave reviews so of course it's on my food bucket list.I came here with a few friends on a somewhat early Saturday evening, and was seated immediately. The decor is warming, a tad crowded because of the narrow aisles, but the ambiance is nice. Let's move on to the food.For appetizers, we ordered chorizo and and codfish fritters. Chorizo is sliced thinly, and doesn't have a strong flavor like I'm used to. The codfish fritters are delicious! So I guess you can tell which one won me over.For entrees, half of us ordered oxtail stew and the other half ordered chicken. I love me a roasted Spanish chicken from time to time, and it's almost always a hit, but I was the other half getting the oxtail. The oxtail is overly salty even when eating it with rice. My blood pressure was rising at a rapid rate. Okay, I'm being dramatic. You get my point. The stewing needs a lighter hand on the salt, and it would have been perfect. The meat tenderly falls off the bone like it should. That salt just ruined it for me. Couldn't even finish the entire entree.No complaints about the service. They are rather hospitable at Rincon Criollo so a good tip is well deserved!"

For appetizers, we had their ham croquettes and plantain chips along with the flattened bread they serve you. The ham croquettes in my opinion was maybe the worse croquettes ever. They were shaped like a breakfast sausage link and tasted ZERO ham. I even had to ask the waiter if this was the ham croquettes and even he acknowledged there was ham in there. Perhaps they blended it or something because there was no hints of ham in that croquette whatsoever. And the way it was deep fried, the batch of oil they used must have no been changed all day or they overcooked it. The plantain chips however were nice. Light golden color and crispy. The flattened bread was unique. I kinda wish it was toasted a little bit longer just it would be a bit toastier and easier for the butter to melt.For our main course, we kept it simple. We ordered the paella once we sat down because it takes up to an hour to cook. It well worth the wait. I've had my fair share of paella in my life and this would easily rank somewhere in my top 3. It's $51.99 to start with, so that kinda threw me off guard because according to their website menu, it's listed at $41.99. So expect $10 dollars more. They should consider updating their website and menu prices. But the paella, it was unbelievably good. It had seafood, chorizo, and chicken. They weren't stingy with the ingredients either. There was plenty of scallops, lobster, and shrimps. It was served nice and hot, straight out of the pot. It was so good and so hard to believe that this was suppose to be a serving size for two. My son loved it!We enjoyed the evening with sangria and I tried a bottle of their Cuban style ale. The bottle of ale was $7. I asked for something from Cuba, but its produced in USA. I was hoping for a actual Cuban cerveza. The sangria was delightful and refreshing. As far as the service goes, I think it could be better. We went on a weekday, it was really empty compared to the weekends here. Much of staff were chatting in the back or at the bar. We felt a little ignored at times. They didn't serve us the flattened bread until one of the main waiters or host noticed it roughly 15-20 minutes after we sat down. But all of the waiters were friendly. I would certainly love to come back for the paella. The biggest downside to dining at Rincon Criollo, they only accept American Express! For me, that's just a huge blow. Master/Visa is pretty much standard everywhere else and this spot is acting like the old Costco with their AMEX only policy. I mean even Costco now is accepting Master, Visa. For reward purposes, I really dislike the fact that they don't accept any other card except for AMEX. So either be prepared to bring cash or use their ATM."

The best Cuban food in NYC. I have been coming with my family and friends since the 70s.  The owners René & Baldo Acosta had a popular restaurante in Cuba. They opened this version of Rincón Criollo in the 70s in Corona, Queens.It's a family run business. Their nephews & niece took over the business and opened a second restaurant in Long Island.René Acosta died recently, it saddened me very much. He will be missed. RIP.The Ropa Vieja, Paella, Chicken & Rice, Frijoles Negros, Moros, Vaca Frita y Bistec Empanizado are the best. Cubano & Croquetas, Mariquitas, Tamales, Frituras de Bacalao.  The list goes on and on.Every day they have a special dish. Today was Rabo Encendido, a very popular dish.Their desserts are also very good. They used to make a Bread Pudding out of this world. Now Flan, Rice Pudding, Cascos de Guayaba, Dulce de Leche, Buñuelos are all good.They serve wine and beers.Ah! To top the meal Cuban Coffee, Cortadito o Café con Leche.And you will be coming back again and again."

We were hangry...which is NOT good when you're trying to enjoy a date-day. Rincon Criollo turned our day around! I am Puerto Rican, so Cuban food is right up my alley. My husband can eat rice and beans like they're going out of style. Our meals were wonderful! We had the deep-fried half-chicken (not battered, just deep-fried with the skin on) with a garlic sauce, the roasted pork, yuca, tostones, and rice with black beans. Flavorful, hot, well-cooked, and we didn't have to wait very long at all. Our servers were very friendly and refilled our water every time we needed it. Really, just a fantastic experience. THE ONLY BAD thing was the birthday singing...I know that sounds horrible, but for people's birthdays they play this horribly loud (like deafening) set of birthday songs. We had to cover our ears and stop eating for the entire 2 songs. This happened 3 times! We had to stop eating, chatting, everything...just to save ourselves from hearing loss. But, other than that...a fantastic meal."

Everything tasted darn near perfect, although I did expect bigger portions cause I was able to finish everything.... Regardless my oxtail was fall off the bone tender and flavorful. Also I love fried plaintains and they do it right here, not greasy at all with the perfect amount of crunch. But back to the main point, TRES LECHE CAKE.

Had the ox tail, the breaded pork chop, rolled steak, fried pork chunk, ropa, fish, mixed paella, arroz compollo ( which is just a paella without the seafood ). The food was just okay here, there was no flavor in anything I ate, it was as if they just pretty much pan fried all the items here and just sprinkled a little bit of salt and presented all the dishes that way, where was the decadent beef taste that usually comes with ox tail? where was the strong hit of garlic that comes with fried pork chunk? the great flavor of stock and umami that comes with a great Paella? all in all although the items tasted ok at best all the items were incredible boring and bland.

We checked in on the food after 30 minutes already and were told just a few more minutes. Eventually same story just a few more minutes. Finally I grabbed somebody else - manager/owner maybe. I tell him that we've been sitting here for an hour and 15. He asked what we ordered, went to the kitchen, and food came out 5 minutes later.

What a cozy and inviting restaurant. Came here a few months ago for a small birthday celebration and truly enjoyed it. As other reviews mentioned, the wait is looong if you come anytime between 6-8:30pm. We came on a Friday night at 6:45 and waited about 45 min to be seated. This speaks to how popular this place is. Service is very friendly and go out of their way to accommodate. Also as we discovered, this is a popular place to come celebrate your birthday. Throughout the evening the severs performed a birthday song for just about every table in the restaurant. Straight to ordering: - Chorizo Espanol ($6.95): good way to start a meal for a male birthday. With meat. - Picadillo ($11.95): chopped meat w/onions and peppers. This was probably my favorite meat entree that we tried. Those grilled onions just added an extra oomph. - Ropa Vieja ($15.95): shredded beef in tomato sauce, thought this was a bit salty but flavor was good and beef was tender. - Rabo Encendido ($15.95): oxtail served in a stew-like sauce. Tender chunks of meat. This was delish too. - Bistec Enrollado ($15.95): rolled steak aka. steak cooked in a roll. This was ok.Two sides came with each entree, we ended up with a combination of: - Moros y Cristianos: rice and beans--omg...I have never had such addicting rice and beans in my life! I never even knew rice and beans could be addicting! Perhaps there were bits of pork fat cooked with it...whatever it was, I couldn't stop eating  them. - Plantanos Maduro Frito: fried sweet plaintains, oldie but a goodie, tho generally pretty heavy and you can't eat too many of them.- Plantano Verde Frito: fried green plaintains, also good.- Yuca con Mojo: cassava stewed with garlic sauce (butter)....yumm again. - Papas Fritas: French fries, not worth ordering here. I must pause here to mention the generous serving sizes of the entree and side dishes. You will not be left hungry. To top it off, somehow we managed to eat a a flan and the bunuelos Rincon Criollo (donuts soaked in syrup) between the four of us. Would recommend the flan, it had a good home-made consistency. Mmmm...rice and beans. I would come back for another plate of these any day (after a week-long workout). Not to mention to try some additional entrees. And certainly you can't beat these prices."

The espresso is made with precision and care. Definitely one of the best espresso's in the area. It is strong and flavorful and meets the quality standards of a much more refined restaurant. The sugar floats on top of the coffee for a brief second prior to submerging itself. This is the sign of excellent espresso. In addition they serve the espresso with lime instead of lemon rind.

Go early!! They don't take reservations. Don't be like me and go on a rainy night because the place gets so packed you'll have to wait by the door and the lines go past that. The breakdown:Place - small, old school feel restaurant and you'll easily feel cramped because they pack the place up like sardines. Good luck with parking around here, it's horrendous. You're better off taking the train and walking less than 2min or take a car service. They do a relatively good job keeping the place clean. Service - average. They get bombarded so it's understandable. Drink - materva yerba mate soda! It tastes like a inka kola to me.Food - great quality food! I ordered the ropaVieja? Shredded pork and it was slamming. Keep in mind with your entree you get 2 side orders - I got the staple of rice & beans (Moro rice) and an order of the yuca which came out perfectly soft.

My coworker told me that there is a scarcity of good Cuban food in Queens. She's from Florida, so she knows. So we met a co worker and her hubby here to try good Cuban food, for a weekend lunch.We ordered 2 apps, and 4 entrees (includes 8 sides- 2 sides per entrée), to share family-style. We devoured thinly sliced chorizos, Cuban tamal, ropa vieja (shredded beef in tomato sauce), oxtails, roast pork, and liver with peppers. We wolfed down black beans, fried sweet plantains, fried potatoes, yuca with garlic sauce and fried plantains. After all that, we still had leftovers. K had a refreshingly cold passion fruit drink. My favorites: If you love garlic, you have to get the yucca with garlic sauce. Soft, starchy cassava boiled to a soft sweet-potato-consistency with this sweet savory garlic sauce. So good! I've never had yucca like that before! The shredded beef with tomato sauce was so good! Tender fall-apart-under-your-fork juicy beef in a sweet homemade red sauce. Yum! Everyone loved this dish.The oxtails was wonderful! Stewed soft cartilaginous oxtail in an tomato-spiced stew. I wish I had ordered two of these. The roasted pork looked dry but wasn't. It was tender and the pork juices in the sauce was excellent! Drool worthy savory pork sauce. My co worker loved the sauce more than the meat.Verdict: Definitely coming back to try more dishes! Everyone loved the food. I want to eat that beautiful breaded steak! And more oxtail please! Transport: This lovely Cuban restaurant in Corona, Queens is easily accessible via the 7 train or by car."

My husband and I probably circled 20 times around the restaurant before we found a spot. But anyways, we came here on a Friday and the wait wasn't too bad. I loved how they would blast the Happy Birthday song and wear a funny hat and glasses and dance around when it was someone's birthday. Created really good vibes.Now onto the food. It was AMAZING. Super tasty! We ordered the oxtail and shredded steak. Their entrees come with two sides each. The rice and beans are marinated with bacon which made it even better. I can't even begin to explain just how flavorful everything was, it's a definite must try.However the guava and cream cheese was a bit overwhelmingly sweet. But yes 5 stars."

This is a cute place and not pricey at all. It gives you a taster you can't forget about. I had the ropa vieja with white rice and black beans there was also some ham Crocketts delicious!!!!

The food was amazing then, and it's even more amazing the second time around! The Lechón asado is to die for! It's juicy, flavorful and trust me, you will want another plate! The Ropa Vieja is incredible; perfectly seasoned and not greasy. Please have it with the Moros and Christianos (Black beans and rice). I haven't been to Cuba yet but I have been to Miami and this rice beats any M&C that I've had there by a landslide. In addition, they offer Cuban beer! My favorite is their sangria though. If you're in the Corona/Jackson Heights area, look no further for an amazing meal. It's a quaint spot and everyone is very accommodating. You will not be disappointed!"

My family loves this place. We have also been to the long Island location as well after a baptism and it was also amazing. The food is the best Cuban you can find in NY and the service is always on point. My twin sister has 4 kids so when we go in at times it becomes a little hectic but they always make us feel welcomed and accommodate. I always bring people visiting me or foodies like myself here and it never fails. Their chiccharron de Pollo  so good with the yucca and garlic. The espresso is a must after the meal.

Pictures of Cuba and clients in the past that ate there. Light Cuban music on the background, Cuban clients and employees talking really makes the place feel authentic. Very charming. Now the food is okay. I need to come back and give it another try. I had the Pollo empanizado con arroz blanco habichuelas negras, tostones, y aguacate. The breaded chicken could've had some Spanish seasoning because it lacked flavor; it was literally breaded chicken. The beans were okay too. I'll get a Cuban dish next time for sure! Tip: Get here early! I don't like crowds (this place is small) so I went an hour after opening hours and it was slowly getting full. Another tip make sure your utensils are clean because mine were dirty and my dates' as well. It's a Small business with great clientele flow is why I would give another try and staff were funny and attentive. It's history and ambience was what really won me over."

I can say that the ambience is great ,the music is pleasant , the staff is polite and overall my visit went great . Now I want to tell you about specifics: The breaded pork was amazing , thin and not too oily . The yuca con mojo was just there not bad but not super ( it was kind of cold and the yucas were so tiny) The tostones were great , as well as the maduros. The beans tasted good , they had potatoes in them which I never seen before but surprisingly the combination  was tasty   . Now I went there because I wanted to try their Ropa Vieja which could have been better  , it was drenched with oil . The moro con cristianos rice was the loser of the night , it lacked Caribbean  sazón. I asked for salad and the waiter brought me plain avocado   I will say he got confused and I decided that it was ok since I love  aguacates. The dessert a flan was delicious and red wine warmed my tummy . I will definitively visit this place again."

It is a small homely spot and super lively. We are here for the infamous paella and we got not one but two! In order to enjoy the paella, you will need to call ahead of time on the same day.We started with red wine sangria - refreshing, fruity, and the best drink to accompany any Spanish meal. Let's keep that pouring! Various of sides started to pour in such as their sweet plantains, tostones, and rice and beans. Tostones was my absolute favorite side of the evening. They were so smash into big pieces and the texture was just the perfect crunchy and soft in the middle.  My companion and I shared the Oxtail dish together. The oxtail meat was so tender and falls off the bones effortlessly. The sauce is tomato based and filled with various spices. Since it was a big dish, I saved a big piece to go with white rice the next day. Seafood and Meat Paella made a grand entrance to our table. The pot was a lot bigger than what I imagined, not to mention how deep the pot is. After our server lifted the lid, the smell of seafood and saffron hit my nose leading to my mouth watering. (I hope no one saw that!) I see lobster, clams, mussels, shrimp, scallop, and chicken, all in there! Flavors of the paella was amazing! I did wish that the texture of the rice was mushy like it was but other than that, it was muy bien (very good)!To my surprise, this spot is a great host for dinner parties for it has a very lively atmosphere. If you have a birthday boy/girl, a staff member will wear a funny hat and glasses dancing to loud, exciting music while bringing a plate of dessert to them! It was very entertaining and I already figured out who I want to surprise! So watch out!"

I ordered the Ropa Vieja con Moros y Cristianos y un orden de Platanos Maduros Frito. If heaven had a taste, it was in my mouth. The Ropa Vieja alone was so flavorful and so tender and so juicy. It was only further accentuated by the taste of the rice and beans. 12/10 would hiiiiiiiiiighly recommend!"

If it's your birthday, it's even better. I came here with my BF for dinner and we were able to experience how they celebrate birthdays (it was another customer's birthday). They turn the lights off, there is a disco ball on, lots of joy and singing and all the other customers are clapping as well! The food here is also really good. I had to ropa vieja. The entrees come with 2 sides. So I ordered the rice and beans, and the boiled yuca in garlic sauce. Although the yuca was a bit dry, the sauce made it tasty. The rice and beans, you can never go wrong with rice and beans. The ropa vieja was tender and full of flavor. The dish looks small but it was enough to fill me and my bf's stomachMy boyfriend ordered the oxtail and he enjoyed it! He said it was very tender and falls right off the bone. He ordered tostones and Maduras as his sides. The tostones were one of the best I've had. The maduras was sweet and tasted like a dessert.For dessert, we had tres leches cake and flan. My bf isn't a fan of flan but he really enjoyed it here! I love flan and this really was THAT good. Their tres leches cake mmmmm you cannot miss out. Their desserts were so good, we ended up ordering another order of the desserts separately!To top it off, the servers here are all polite and nice."

Ive been goin to this spot since i was 10 years old and still take the drive to go there now being 35 years old. Place is tiny. Looks like a hole in the wall because of the location and the neighborhood u have to drive thru but the food is by far the best. Highly recommend. They have a much nicer and bigger location in Huntington which is where we go now. Far drive but worth it if u want a more exclusive scenery.

One heads up though if you want the signature Paella I would call ahead of time because this rookie didn't and we had to wait for an hour but lesson learned that just gave us some time to hang out and drink some wine and try out some of the other things on the menu...First off the plantain chips with garlic sauce....my kids loved these and even the garlic sauce with a little kick was a huge hit. They were sooooo good! Next sweet and green plantains hard to choose but both were again delicious...on to some more wine and some more of the bread as well they bring out. Need to throw in all of the servers here are awesome and walk around checking on people...one of the waiters even walked over to a table with a fussy baby and asked the mom if he could walk the baby around so she and her husband could eat their dinner...you don't see this kind of service. I asked him he knew  them and he no just want her to enjoy her food as he is showing us the cute little baby. Now after the anticipated wait out comes this huge steam pot of Paella and you can smell all of the deliciousness coming out with all the fresh seafood...time to dive in and watch out this has been cooking for an hour it is very hot, but OMG so delicious. The amount of seafood that is packed here is impressive with fish, shrimp, scallops, clams and crab...hands down one of the best dishes I have ever had. My girls ordered their grilled  chicken and stopped eating theirs just to help polish off all of this Paella it was that good.

The tables are pretty close and the place is pretty small.The servers were very friendly and if you never had or are new to Cuban food they will explain in detail (which we really didn't need.)  We had the maduros, pollo asado, moro rice, rice and beans, ropa vieja. The Pollo Asado and Ropa Vieja were both in the salty end. The Ropa Veija was cooked to perfection and melted in your mouth, it was just too salty. We also had the tres leches and I was not really impressed. For $5 for a slice, I could barely even split it with my friend.  We also ordered ""sangria."" Do NOT get sangria here. The server went behind the bar got a slice of orange and cherry garnish and put it in the bottom of the glass and poured wine on top. That is not sangria my friend.In sum, whoever cooked on Friday night was very heavy handed on the adobo. The portions were on the smaller side for the prices we paid approx. $16 for ropa vieja. I was not impressed and I honestly do not think it was worth it for the price we paid.**Also, they only accept AMEX  but there is a Bank of America across the street, a Chase bank down the block or you can pay a fee and use the ATM machine in the restaurant."

I came upon this place and was very disappointed that they didn't sell any. I mean. with a name like ""Rincon Crayola"" you would think they would have f***ing Crayola pens wouldn't you???????? I mean srsly???!!???!?!!!!111 So I am giving them a 1 star rating.Just kidding.What to get: Ropa ViejaWhat not to get: Coconut FlanWhat else: Don't ask for ice in your drink. They have a ""Cube-ban"" in effect.So I wanted some donuts. I came here and they had none. So why the hell are they named Rincon Cruler?I've been to Rincon Criollo twice and both times I had the Ropa Vieja. It is by far, easily, hands down the best Cuban food I've had anywhere in NYC. While it is very heavy and greasy, it is also absolutely delicious, and all fans of Latin food should try it. I've also had the Coconut Flan on one occasion, and I was not impressed. It was ultra-sweet to the level of sickliness, so I couldn't finish it.I came here for some healthy suplements. They had none. So why the hell are they called Rincon Krill Oil?Of course this place has been featured on TV, so you probably know about it already. Unlike many of the Food Network's pay-for-play choices, this one is ""the real deal"" as they'd say in their clichéd way. It tastes as good as it's supposed to. In fact, it tastes better.So I came here for some New Orleans Cajun food. I asked for Gumbo, Crawfish and a Po Boy. They had *none* of them. So why the hell are they named Rincon Creole?The only better Cuban meal I've had in the country, other than one in New Jersey which rivals Rincon, is Luis Galindo II's Vaca Frita in Miami, near the airport. Also Paseo's sandwiches are right up there, as are El Cubanito's in Chicago. Nevertheless, you won't get a better Ropa Vieja than this.I came here looking for Melissa Joan Hart. She was not here. So why the f*** are they named ""Rincon Clarissa-Explains-It-All?""The meat is so tender and stringy and juicy and perfectly spiced and flavoured. Soaked for days, it seems like. The heavy, greasy dark brown rice is exceptionally tasty, especially if you ask them to pour some marinade/juice from the meat all over the rice. And the plantains that come with the dish are fried to perfection, very sweet but very delicious and satisfying. They basically taste like soft, mushy, sweet bananas. So tropical and so indescribably delicious.Get down to Rincon Criollo at your earliest convenience. I love it so much, that I would have written this review in Rincon Crayola if I had to.And I brought a girl here who was really into me. We couldn't wait for the hotel room so we went straight in the RC bathroom. After what happened in there, I think I'm going to rename the place ""Rincon Creamalloverme."""

From the start, the ambiance they provide you with from the low salsa playing in the background to all the photographs of past patrons on the walls, to the way their waitstaff stands around at your order makes you feel like you're dining in a different era. The servers are attentive and as hospitable as it gets; very friendly, very inviting, and most importantly very honest. The menu is big enough to have something for everyone, but it doesn't lose focus or sabotage itself with irrelevant ""universal"" items like a burger for example that would only subtract from its Cuban identity. This is GOOD FOOD. The ropa vieja is probably what they're most known for, and yes it is as delicious as you've heard. On my last visit I ordered the half roasted chicken and man I left those bones clean. The meat just fell right off, no need for a knife. When cleaning the table our server joked saying ""so you liked the chicken huh?"". There is nothing in this restaurant that lacks flavor. The food tells a story.I've lived in Corona & Elmhurst all my life, and in many of the other hispanic/latino restaurants around here - sides like rice and beans, tostones or fried plantains are often bland or overcooked; just barely ""meh"". They don't get shown the love they deserve....but here, the sides share the spotlight. Everything is served on individual separate plates, which aside from giving you that classic feeling; allows you to appreciate each component on its own. You want to take a little bite of this, a spoon of that, a little scoop of this, another bite of that. A good meal is all about different textures, flavors, and the way they compliment each other; they nail that perfectly. Pricing is adequate and you'll never feel robbed. It's a casual enough place to dress however you want, and at the same time I can picture a dressed up date night situation as well. There is no pretentiousness at all. No matter what the occasion, the vibes are always right. Highly recommended, and a definite a top choice."

Decor feels like a diner. Prices are good. Portions are good. Ropa vieja was great although a little on the salty side. Yucca melts in your mouth. Plaintain was perfectly ripe...nice n  sweet.

Chicken and Sausage Paella is a must try. The Paella advertises for 2 people but it serves 4 people!!! Ox tail stew is also very good. Great service on the staff side. Would come back again.

My boyfriend's family has been coming here for years and I discovered it through them. We love it so much it keeps being a birthday spot for us year after year (not very true, we come on random occasions too). It's always great food that reminds you of home. The portions are always big so at times I may split a meal with someone and it's plenty to fill both people. The service is always pleasant and fun. If you go on a Friday, Saturday or even Sunday be prepared to wait for a table because they are always packed hence, go on a weekday! My fav dishes: ropa vieja, vaca frita, rabo (oxtail), rincón bistec (med rare if not they'll cook it well) not so fav: the fillet in garlic sauce has been the only thing that I wasn't a fan of because I thought it was just too greasy. I've never tried the Cuban sandwich but that's on my bucket list at Rincon. Great place !"

I didn't get a chance to taste it until this time because I never ordered in, but it's amazing! Please do call an hour or two in advance to get it!!Rolled steak is another favorite, along with fried plantains and sweet fried plantains, I'm sold!The prior review still stands, of course.Birthdays are so much fun here!

We were seated right away on a Saturday afternoon but it filled up pretty quickly. All I can say is everything was absolutely delicious! The food was piping hot when it came out and the bill was very attractive. The stuffed cassava it's stuffed with beef and the oxtail was my favorites. If you like Cuban food you definitely should check this place out.

Food tastes like there's a little, old grandma in the kitchen whipping up authentic dishes. Staff are always attentive, energetic and upbeat. For birthdays, they bring out a coconut flan (which is amazing but not free) and they dance and clap to a happy birthday song blasting through the speakers. It's lots fun! I highly recommend the Chicharron de Pollo (fried chicken) and Ropa Vieja (shredded beef). Place is always busy but usually wait time is not too long."

It's a small, homey place with delicious food and the service is just as wonderful. The staff is very inviting and treat you like a part of the family. Portions are generous and are served tapas style, which allows you to try various items off the menu. I highly recommend stopping by this restaurant and try my personal favorite, ropa vieja."

Rincon Criollo was featured on the show. I was excited to learn that an authentic Cuban restaurant was located in Queens. I grew up as a young lad in Corona, so we decided to venture out to try this place.The joint is literally a few hundred feet  from the NYC number 7 train station off Roosevelt ave. When we first walked in the servers were polite and seated us quickly. We were also greeted by the chef/owner Rudy who was on the show and was working the floor that night. Unbeknownst  to me as we sat down, a fellow yelper and friend ""Long K"" recognized me and quickly introduced himself first via an instant message on Yelp. ""Long K"" was funny as he wanted to put me at ease to not think he was creepy for recognizing me. LOL!My wife thought it was kind of cool to have someone on yelp recognize me. It was nice to finally meet a fellow yelper for the 1st time without going to a Yelp event. I Hope to meet more fellow Yelpers in the future in Elite and UYE events though. Thanks ""Long K""! because of you my wife actually thinks I'm sort of like a ""Movie Star"" minus the good looks and money!We were hungry and I wished I would have read ""Long K's"" review about calling up to place your order for the Paella since it does take an hour to cook, but we didn't have the time or patience to wait that long for our food. I'll savor the paella for another date. We ordered the Rolled Steak which was a Cuban version of ""chicken cordon bleu"" minus the chicken and rolled in what appears to be a flank steak pounded thin and stuffed with ham and Swiss cheese and deep fried. The rolled steak was delicious, I mean who doesn't like meat and melted cheese together, right? A huge portion size cut into 3 segments.We also ordered the 1/2 Rincon Crioillo chicken - Garlic chicken deep fried and topped with raw sweet onions coated with garlic. The chicken was moist and delicious and the raw onions coupled  together with the chicken made my mouth and taste buds happy!The sides were amazingly good, we had the beans and rice cooked together, cassava with garlic, sweet plantains and as the owner Rudy calls them ""Cuban fries"" actually they were regular cut fries that were a little on the soggy side. We were so stuffed we passed on the dessert, but had to have the Cuban coffee, my wife asked Rudy is it really Cuban?? Rudy responded by telling her ""As Cuban as it gets"". I agree, a Cuban man brewing Cuban Coffee beans is as Cuban as it gets! Veridict! The coffee was strong almost espresso like, but not bitter with a very smooth finish and taste.The staff here is so genuine and kind and you can see the love they have for the customer's and it's sincere and not contrived . This place truly is a Gem in an area heavily populated by latino restaurants. Rincon Criollo as Rudy said earlier to my wife ""It's as Cuban as it gets! Que the ""Charanga"" music!"

The restaurant has a family vibe to it and the staff was very friendly. We were surprisingly seated immediately. We ordered the pitcher of sangria to start and I must say it was very good. For entrees my girlfriend had the chicharron de pollo and I had the arroz con pollo and for something so simple the food was great. Full of flavor and amazing. The portion wasn't big but the taste made up for it. Afterwards we shared the coconut flan and again so simple but soooo good. We Wil definitely be coming back

I am OK with those options since I have an american express, but for others it could be an issue.  Also the prices are slightly greater than other restaurants nearby. The portions for what you pay are not that big. The taste does help with these shortfalls the restaurant has."

Pro Tip: Call in advance before arriving to the restaurant, the paella takes at least 1 hour to cook! Also pretty interesting to watch how this place does it, videos online from Guy Fieri's Triple D's!Advertised as portions for 2 people, this giant vat of steaming rice, chicken and seafood definitely feeds at least 3-5. A must order if you're coming here. Only complaint was that it may be a bit salty after a while. Vaca Frita was a good dish of shredded beef, which was a bit salty as well, but still delicious protein. We got sides of maduros and fried yuca (not on menu but our server had no issue getting that done for us) which were perfect. The Coconut Flan for dessert fills in the remaining gaps in your stomach and will make you sleep easy at night.Service is super friendly, but can fall off a bit when the place gets busy. You should come here for someone's birthday occasion...just to watch all the lights go down and hilarious celebration with disco lights ensue. They go hard for peoples birthdays here..."

Okay now on to the food. We ordered our favorite the croquettes, which I always order when going to a Cuban restaurant, and unfortunately I wasn't impressed, I actually didn't enjoy them at all, I've had better at other Cuban restaurants, and for that they lost a star. We did have a appetizer with mixed meet, the pork was delicious, I also enjoyed the sausage, it also comes with ham, cheese, and olives. For dinner we both had the steak with onions, considering that's common Cuban meal, with the congri (rice with black beans) also a Cuban favorite, and it was absolutely Delicious!!!!!! I was in a food coma after finishing my meal. We couldn't leave without some cuban coffee, which was so good & strong, the flan was wayyyyyy too sweet. Service was good, but the food came out VERY fast, almost felt like we were being rushed out, wasn't able to enjoy or finish the appetizers before the entree came out."

After having it bookmarked for a while now, I could not wait any longer. Brought my mom and hubby here and they also loved it! This place is surely a hidden gem in Corona that's not to be missed out on. So let's start with the vibe of this place. The restaurant is small, but offers a nice homely ambience. Staff is absolutely wonderful and friendly. We came here around 9pm tonight and it was pretty crowded for a Monday night, but things seem to be running smoothly. They gave us some complimentary, delicious, hot bread to start off with. All I can say is, ""may I have seconds pls?"". After reading many reviews, we decided to opt for their famous Chicarones De Pollo (Fried Chicken Bits) and Vaca Fritta (Shredded Beef with Garlic) with sides of Arroz Blanco (White Rice), Beans, Avocado Salad (that just basically just Avocado) and Plantano Maduro (Fried Sweet Plantains). Here's my opinion on each item: - Chicarones De Pollo: OMG! These little monsters are AMAZING!! Crispy, Juicy, Salty, Garlicky deliciousness that you make you say WOW! About $14 for 5 pieces that are well worth the price. This seriously stole the night for me! That sauce with the onions and rice....ah, now that was a killer! A must order when here! - Vaca Fritta: Being South Asian, we have a very similar version of this type of shredded beef, so I was really looking forward to this dish here. It was deliciously prepared and tasted great, however I thought that it was a bit salty for my taste. If the salt was a bit less, it would have been perfect! - The Sides: $3 for plain Avocado Salad (Plain Avocado that is), I felt it's a bit too much. Arroz Blanco, tasted delicious (white rice cooked in olive oil and salt). Pantano Maduro my mom and husband loved this side dish, I didn't try it because I'm not much into fried plantains. Beans were also good. Overall, all the side dishes were plentiful. Though our food took about 35mins to get served it was worth the wait for the Chicarones De Pollo. I'm really glad that I finally tried this place out! I'm definitely returning back here to try out some of the other delicious items on the menu!Tip: if you don't eat pork, don't order the rice cooked with beans as it has pork in it. Thus, I was unable to try this dish."

I saw the birthday celebration thingy on some yelp reviews and decided to come here for my friend's birthday. I don't take they take reservations but we were there pretty early so we were able to get seats. I walked in and quietly told the waiter it was my friend's birthday and he was like okay okay and gave me a few winks. We ordered the shrimp in garlic sauce, the stuffed beef, and the oxtail stew. Each dish comes with 2 sides so we got plantains and rice for the most part. Everything was delicious. My personal favorite was the beef. It was fried and was basically layers of beef, cheese, and ham. I usually am not a fan of ham but it tasted really good together. We also ordered a mango juice which was soooo good.For dessert we got tres leche cake and these little donut things I can't remember the name of. I can't have milk but my friends really enjoyed the tres leches cakes. As they were bringing out the cake with a candle, a disco ball came down and a super loud birthday song came on. The waiter did a little dance/performance that was so much fun and we were all cracking up. The entire restaurant was clapping along and saying happy birthday. It was a really nice and friendly atmosphere. My favorite thing about this restaurant though is easily the service. While everything was delicious, the service was just the absolute best. The waiter was so nice and so friendly to us. He had us try to order in spanish which was so cute. I just love this place and I would highly recommend especially if you're celebrating a birthday. It makes for great snaps and videos!"

I came with a group of friend on a friday afternoon for a birthday celebration. It was EXTREMELY hot outside, probably 100 degrees. As soon as I walked in I noticed that there were only ceiling fans... no AC. As time passed by this just bothered us more and more. We couldn't enjoy our food because it was just so hot and we were sweating. The food was OK... The steak and rice were dry. I've had better and cheaper..The way the waiter sang happy birthday to my friend was super cute and enthusiastic. They also didn't charge for the birthday flan which was a nice surprise.

The bartender greeted us immediately & put a Hutuey Cuban beer in each of our hand. The paella was served within 5 minutes of us sitting down at the table & is served literally in a pot; it's a lot of food. This meal can easily serve 4 people, so we brought home a gigantic amount of leftovers!! I absolutely love this gem in Corona!!"

Apparently, this restaurant was featured on his show!  Good sign.I was half asleep (nothing to do with my date) so I ordered an iced coffee, which wasn't exactly my definition of iced coffee, but it was delicious nonetheless. My date ordered a sangria and enjoyed it.  We had oxtail and Ropa Vieja with white rice and beans, Yucca and sweet plantains as sides. We were also offered a complimentary flan which was a great way to end our already satisfying meal.What was more noteworthy is the exceptional service. Waiters were genuinely friendly and had smiles on their faces throughout our dinner. One even put the toilet seat down for me when I had to use the Men's room because the Ladies' room was occupied. What more can you ask for?It ended up pouring after our dinner while my date and I went hunting for his car. However, it was a memorable moment after a memorable dinner ... with someone I can now call my bf"

Yes, I eat a TON of Spanish food. So having lived in a predominantly Spanish neighborhood my whole life and being a foodie, you learn to explore your surroundings. I never really cared where the origin of my food came from, at the end of the day, good food is good food. I can say that I have eaten Colombian food, Mexican food, Ecuadorian Food, Dominican Food, Puerto Rican food, Peruvian food, Argentinian food, Uruguayan food, and Cuban food. Rincon Criollo is a Queens institution and it's been open for the better half of 60 years. The decor seems like something straight out of Cuba and the service is always welcoming and friendly. Btw, their Bday celebrations at the restaurant are very ""festive."" I have yet to order the super popular dish here, the Arroz con Pollo, think I will try this when I get a group of people to go. Oh, and this place was also featured on Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives.The food:Croquetas de Jamon- Ham croquettes. This dish is so near and dear to my heart. A few feet away on Junction, there used to be the Broadway Sandwich shop and the croquettes here tastes exactly like the ones in the other restaurant. These are essentially ham croquettes, but don't think of the regular ham you normally think of, it's more like ground up pieces of pork with mashed potatoes with a slightly crunchy exterior. I love it! yelp.com/user_local_phot…Rabo Encendido- Oxtail stew. It's essentially an oxtail stew in a tomato based broth. The dish was really great, the oxtail was nice and tender and the tomato adds a touch of acidity. The oxtail itself was a good size and the meat was pretty easy to get to. The order comes with two sides, I chose the tostones which was good but could be a little more crisp and the Moros y Cristianos. yelp.com/user_local_phot… yelp.com/user_local_phot…Masitas de Puerco Frita- Fried pork chunks- I really enjoyed this dish, the pork was so flavorful and the texture of the pork was great. It was basically like a pork chicharron and it was tender, juicy and the raw onions added a nice balance. yelp.com/user_local_phot…Ropa Vieja- Shredded flank steak in tomato sauce. This dish is one of Cuba's most popular dishes and it didn't appeal to me in the beginning because I am not a fan of any kind of shredded meat. The dish here was really good. The broth was slightly sweet and the beef was really tender, this is a must order. yelp.com/user_local_phot…Lechon Asado- Roast pork. I ordered this roast pork dish on Sunday and boy is it a lot of food. The sides I picked were Moros y Cristianos and Yuca con Mojo. Moros y Cristianos was kinda like purple rice with beans already cooked inside with small chunks of pork, this was probably one of my fav rice dishes. The Yuca con Mojo is cassava with garlic sauce, the garlic was intense, don't exhale too hard lol The cassava was really soft and the garlic was nice but it's a little plain. The pork was nicely cooked, too bad there was no crunchy skin =( It was a nicely cooked roast pork dish, too bad it was on the salty side. yelp.com/user_local_phot…Sandwiche Cubano- The Cubano sandwich here was solid. It's a big ass pressed sandwich with ham, roast pork, swiss cheese, mustard and pickles. It's a nice sandwich but I remember thinking the bread could be a little better.Bistec De Puerco Empanizado- Breaded pork steak. It's a pork cutlet that is really pounded out. The flavors are nice and the pork was really tender but the dish was on the greasy side.Bunuelos Rincon Criollo- they are essentially doughnuts in a simple syrup. The doughnuts are made of yuca, sweet potato and anise. The doughnuts are nice and crisp, the inside is nice but it's a little redundant. And the simple syrup is a tad sweet. yelp.com/user_local_phot…"

I had a hard time choosing a meal, but ultimately ordered the pollo empanizado con moros y cristianos, as highlighted in one of Amy C.'s pictures. The food did not disappoint. The piece of fried chicken was huge. I asked for an extra helping of grilled onions and this definitely did the trick. They were sliced thick and buttery. A great complement to the chicken, which doesn't come with a sauce. I also ordered some plantains, and they were nice and crunchy on the ends.To drink I had a glass of sangria for $5, which had the right balance of sweetness and alcohol.The decor was inviting, as many others have said, it takes you back to Cuba or perhaps a Spaniard restaurant. My only critique is that the waiter was a little cheeky when I asked him about the menu and I'm not sure that this was entirely appreciated; a straight-forward answer on what dishes were most popular would have worked just fine."

Having such great reviews I went to this restaurant without hesitation. Half way into our meal I look down at my baby's high chair and a ROACH was crawling from the kitchen to my baby's chair  I immediately advise the two workers who were having lunch right behind us. He quickly stomped the roach and said ""oh it's NY you know..."" Excuse me ?! I wish I would have snapped a picture but I was so frighten about the roach that it didn't even occur to me at the time. I didn't know how to handle the situation but I think they should have given us a free meal or a discount. I just wanted to get out ... fast ! When it came to paying for the check they avoided eye contact & pretend as tho the incident did not happen. NOT OKAY ... Please think twice before eating in that establishment."

We were seated immediately. Waiter was very polite and attentive. Giving only 2 stars because :  1) waiter accidentally spit on my plate as he was taking our order (ok it's an accident & happens but... ewww) 2) we were accidentally poured wine we didn't order , we thought it was a fancy freebee, lol, thankfully we didn't drink it before they ran to take it away without apology, 3) we ordered the Palomilla . It was very thin, dry and still a struggle to cut with the knife and almost impossible to chew. I literally had to pull it out of my mouth.  The ropa vieja was a little chewy and too salty but flavor was ok. The Spanish sausage was too oily but taste good. The yuca was delicious.  Maybe we just were not lucky with our order but I probably would not go there again."

It has been one of my regulars ever since. The decor is festive and inviting and the waitstaff is very friendly. Most importantly, the food is phenomenal, comforting, and packed with flavor. The Ropa Vieja is perfect: tender, juicy, pulled meaty goodness.. Exactly what it should be. Also love the oxtail stew, and the pollo asado: a generous 1/2 chicken with a bright, delicious marinade. Each main dish comes with two sides, and they are all phenomenal, especially the fried sweet plantains. For desert, the tres leches is a must! Definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone who loves Cuban food, or just food in general."

I will be sure to bring more of my other friends back! We ordered the chicken and seafood paella. They say that is for two but I saw it's more like for six people. Even with four people taking it down, we still have leftovers (I'm enjoying it for lunch right now and it still tastes and smells amazing!) In addition, we had the oxtail and the shredded beef. ALL MY FAVORITES! I would go there and have the same exact meal! Sorry for not posting photos. The paella took 30 mins to make so by the time the food arrived at my table, I was simply too hungry and ate everything in sight! For sides, we got sweet plaintains (yum), fried yuza (omg yes!!! i want more), beans (okay) and fried plaintains (I prefer the sweet ones instead!). Already trying to gather a group to go back! so good!! Maybe even my parents will like it!!Note: this place was featured in Food Network (a friend told me) so it's definitely worth your time!"

This place is kinda dated. The outside needs some freshening up. Its in a very busy area right next to the train. Its very hard to find parking. I found a parking across the street after circling the block a couple of times, but i needed to feed the meter and it was only a 2 hour parking. The outside sign is very dated and dingy looking. This place needs a face lift. Its a little old. The floor tiles look old and i saw some tiles broken. It just needs a little TLC. When I walked in, I was immediately greeted and seated.  Overall It has a cozy vibe, and there's light music playing in the background. Its sexy. Pictures everywhere. Lights are dim. Its great for couples. They sat me down right away. I ordered the ropa vieja, maduros (sweet plantains), white rice and black beans. I also ordered cuban beer. Everything was delicious and came out right away. I loved the ropa vieja which is shredded beef and had an amazing aroma and tasted amazing. The maduros were perfect, just a little crispy in the outside and soft in the middle which I love!! The waiter was attentive, but not in my face which I appreciated. The food was fantastic and I would definitely return when I'm in the area."

Everything that we ordered were full of flavor. Lots of garlic flavor! If you love garlic flavor, you'll love the fish rincon criollo. The decor is nice.

The roast pork is juicy, accompanied with two sides, and it's more than enough for two people to share and for such a good price!! The service here is excellent. Our waiter, whom I sadly didn't catch his name, was super friendly, funny and everything you could ask for in a good waiter. I only deducted a star because although the decor gives it an old timely look, the chairs weren't in very good condition. And the plate I was given was greasy from not being washed well.Other than that, I would definitely come back."

I finally went a few weeks ago with 3 buddies before going to a mets game. This restaurant is only about a mile away from the stadium so it's convenient for a pre game meal. We ordered the arroz con pollo and it was good but disappointing. The problem is that it takes an hour to cook. So we ordered a lot of other food and we were full by the time this came to the table. It was very flavorful but the wait time is what kept it from being as good as I had hoped.Our waiter was great and we tried three other entrees at his recommendation. A beef dish, a chicken dish and a pork dish. We also tried every side they had. Everything we ate was delicious and flavorful. When the bill came it was only about $40 each and that includes a big tip for the excellent wait staff.We ate our faces off and it only cost $40 a man. We also got sangria which was tasty and I usually don't even like sangria. The only bad thing besides the arroz con pollo wait was we were so full and it was so hot out it was hard to enjoy the mets game."

It's perfect to nosh on while waiting for the main course. I put some of the pork, ham and cheese on a piece of their bread to make mini Cuban sandwiches.For our main courses my wife ordered the Lechon Asado, succulent shredded pork with just the right amount of fat that adds to the flavor. I ordered the Ropa Viejo again. It was just as good as the first time I ordered it. Flavorful shredded beef in an onion and tomato sauce.Each main course comes with two sides. We ordered the beans cooked together with rice, the fried sweet plantains, an order of papas fritas and a house salad. All were quite good and we both shared everything. They do not skimp on their portions and we had enough Lechon Asado, rice and beans and plantains to take home for lunch on another day.The best surprise of our first visit was their homemade frozen lemonade. We ordered it once again it really goes well with their cooking. I also like the fact that they can tailor the sweetness to your liking.We will be going back because there are many other dishes on the menu that we want to try.Give Rincon Criollo a try.

Rincon Criollo brings back memories and transports me to another time, another place. I have never been to Cuba but I get the similar vibe in the old school restaurants in the Dominican Republic.The food here is cooked and seasoned the way it should be. We ordered croquetas de jamon (fried sticks made of potato and ham pureed), frituras de balacao (fried salted cod), Rabo Encendido (stewed oxtail) and flan de coco (which I took to go, because I was so full! The flan is good, goes great with unsweeten tea or coffee).The croquetas took me back in time, when I used to snack on them during recess back in grade school. Croquetas de jamon with a cup of soda. Hmm... good times.If you ordered appetizers, I would suggest you to share the entree since the portion is generous. The oxtail stew was delicious and well sized for the price, dare I say that you won't be getting this much for $14 with 2 sides if you were at a Jamaican restaurant. The rice is cooked perfectly, with right amount of oil and salt; the beans were cooked long enough that they are flavored and half broken. Before you pour the beans on the rice, put some of that meat sauce on the rice. Hmm... good times.I must point out that their maduros (yellow plantains) were cooked perfectly. Riped plantains, right thickness and pan fried to the point where it is slightly burned on the edges to bring in that crisp of caramelization. To wrap up your meal correctly, you'll need some coffee. We ordered cortaditos which were fabulous! Don't skip this unless you don't do espresso.The food is good, 4 stars. What take it up to 5 stars is the service and the atmostphere. The waiting staff is friendly and attentive. The vibe of the restaurant is just so Hispanic Caribbean old fashion: you just want to relax, sit back and enjoy your meal."

I had such a delicious, jovial meal with my friends at Rincon Criollo, and I can't wait to take my other friends and family here next time we have a hankering for Cuban food (or just good 'noms). The place is small, so be wary of brining parties more than 5 (I assume there will be a wait - my friends and I lucked out and got seated right away.) The service was sweet, and were more than happy to give us suggestions. Oh but be warned: the place ONLY takes cash or AmEx (usually it's the opposite).All the food is great, but let me start with the only negative part of this review: avoid the croquetas. I'm sucker for those things, so I ordered them, but they were a little too over-fried for my tastes. Not terrible by any means, but I would not order those again.Everything else was superb - the mariquitas (plantain chips) were thin, crispy, and addictive. I love how here, every entree comes with two sides of your choice. I went with the chicharron de pollo with maduros and moros y cristianos (rice and beans). THIS is what I consider comfort food. The crispy, juicy chicken pieces with garlic and onion made the chicharron more than live up to the hype. The rice and beans were hearty, and the maduros were the ideal combination of crispy on the outside, soft on the inside. I also got to try my friend's Pechuga Rincon Criollo with grilled onions, which was delicious.I can't wait to go back to try the ropa vieja and other specialities there. Also a bonus are the reasonable prices for such generous portions. In a culinary heaven of a neighborhood/borough, Rincon Criollo is a gem."

(Too soon?) Can I tell you that my boots were completely smoked after having one of the best meals ever here?!Ok so I heard about this joint on Triple Ds on food network. I've been to a couple places featured on it and have been completely underwhelmed. Even peeping the pics on Yelp before coming through, I thought the pics were ""meh"". But sh*t!! if you ever were judge a book by its cover? Rincon Criolla is not the one to be f*cked with, in any sense of the word. Literally everything was SPOT on from soup to nuts.The vibe here is no frills casual but super lively, the staff, patrons, service and most importantly when dining out THE FOOD was on pointttttt. There isn't  one flaw that I could think of to dock a star, this is one of the occasions where I wish there were 6 stars! Alright my fan girl rant is done..I went with a food buddy of mine and we covered all the bases to get a feel for what Rincon had to offer.. I pregamed beforehand so I skipped over the alcohol (beer and wine only btw) and opted for a mango shake minus the milk because I'm a lactard, damn these Asian genes!! And it was yummers without it; fresh mango and not diabetically sweet. Even the house bread was good, they press it on a panini grill to ensure you get hot crispy greatness. Now onto the main event..For appy's we got the chicken soup; super home-y.Chicken Salad that consisted of grilled chicken, sliced tomato, avocado, iceberg lettuce in a simple vinaigrette. As simple as in sounds this would be one of those cases where less is definitely more. And lastly the chorizo appetizer that came on a hot plate; delish! Especially after dunking the bread in the sauce.For the mains (which came with 2 sides each) we opted for:Braised oxtail; ridiculously tender!! So much so that if you were to even glance at it the meat fell off the bone the sauce was heavenly to boot, I found myself dunking the bread in more than I'd like to admitRopa Vieja (English translation) means torn clothes, shit if my torn clothes tasted like this I'd have no wardrobe. It's shredded flank steak that's stewed in an unctuous tomato sauce I didn't even bother taking pics because it truly would not do it justice. I swear someone's abuela was in the back putting her foot up all in this dish.The side were definitely nothing to sneeze at we got the fried sweet plantains, yuca in that garlicky mojo sauce, and of course black beans and rice. Coming in thinking that this would be way too much food and we'd have leftovers I found myself about ready to lick the damn plate!! And in true Cuban fashion finished the meal with the traditional Flan and Cafe con Leche, it was amazeballs!! Perfect ending for the best Cuban food on the planet. The cafe con leche cured the itis that I would later endureService was great without being annoying or overbearing so salute to them for that. I'm seriously fantasizing about my next trip here, leaving the restaurant I couldn't help but think out loud what an awesome foodie experience it was....P.S. If you're in the area and pass this up, you will be the biggest ass clown ever!?P.P.S I was not paid for this kick ass review"

I can see myself making a special trip here every time I'm in the metro area. Today... a massive feast for lunch, one which our eyes clearly were bigger than our stomachs. But who's complaining?Ropa Vieja - a massive plate of finely shredded beef in a tomato sauce accompanied (for the rest of the meal as well) with a very garlic laden butter. Oh dear... marvelous.Half Roast Chicken - falling off the bone tender and moist, flavor packed, a few nice crispy bits on the ends we eagerly devouredTwo orders of black beansOrder white ricePlantain chipsTotal bill, around $35.00. A steal.Honestly, the chicken and one order of rice and beans would have fed us without the rest, but we did our best and plowed through as much as possible. What a marvelous and filling meal, possibly our last of the day. So, my last visit I rated it four stars but I'm going with five this time which is about what 200+ other Yelpers have agreed upon at 4.5. I can't argue with food this good. Perfectly seasoned, plenty of it, solid all the way around and no shortcuts. Clearly an area favorite and likely the best Cuban cuisine in the entire metro area. Oh, and the music playing over the speakers today, superb. I'll be back!"

Almost towards the end of the meal, my son found a long black hair in the Ropa Vieja. He took it out and placed it on another plate. I discretely brought it up to the the attention of the waitress who was cleaning our table. She immediately looked at my son who happens to have dark hair and said, ""oh, there is no one with black hair working in the kitchen. But, we see this all the time."" I was perplexed and extremely annoyed. Did she think we wanted a free meal? If that were the case, we would have made a far bigger deal.If they really see this all the time, then they have bigger issues in their kitchen. By the way, we paid our entire bill.

Maybe I'm too picky because I'm actually Cuban and grew up eating legit Cuban food all day every day, made by my mom and in amazing Miami world known restaurants such as Versailles, La Carreta, La Havana Vieja. And I've been to Cuba a handful of times.Lol, these people didn't have media noche which is what I came looking for in the first place. Then I ask if there was Milanesa de res. they tell me yes, and bring out a simple bistec empanizado. I later did my research and found out that Mexicans refer to simple breaded steak as Milanesa. I guess I put my hopes too high up for New York after finding amazing Cuban cuisine such as Havana Social in the meat packing distract (totally worth the money).The worse part of it all was being contradicted.... I'm Cuban and I ask what's up and the waiter has the AUDACITY to tell ME that that's not how it's served in Cuban restaurants LOL. Maybe he just didn't realize I was Cuban but that's very disrespectful and offensive. And even then I explained. They were nice enough about it at least to offer something else but I was too hungry out of work to ask for something else. Then the other guy was nicer about it but again not Cuban and again talked about things he didn't know about. He asked me why I didn't get some real Cuban food and not Milanesa. Yes, Milanese obviously has an Italian origin but it's a staple food for Cubans hence why they serve it in world renowned Cuban restaurants. At this point I was too annoyed to keep explaining myself. Pizza is Italian so it's no longer an American staple food?? Lol tsk tsk. So much for boasting about ""authentic"" Cuban food. Whatever, I just don't like when people talk to me like I'm stupid when I'm trying to eat. I thought my most offended moment would be somewhere in Manhattan but nope it was now in queens. It's tactless to try to correct someone's culture when you aren't actually from there.To make things worse, I wanted sangria and it wasn't great at all. Very small glass with just a slice of orange inside. Lol....Not coming back! I'm sure the food tastes delicious when you don't have expectations or when no one is being rude.  Maybe some of their other dishes are okay, who knows. There was one girl working there who seemed to have a good attitude and looked very nice. For authentic Cuban food that is even better than some in Miami definitely visit the meat packing district! I was definitely impressed."

Black beans lacked flavor with no bay leaf in sight. Fried yuca was flavorless, had strange coating & was  served luke warm not freshly fried - was this frozen? Rice was ok but maybe this was reheated too was not stellar. Fried red snapper was ok but did not come with amy sauce like a mojo. Only reason not giving 1 star is because servers were super friendly and attentive and cuba style coffee (cortaditos) were good. I had not been in couple years but seems it went down hill. Maybe because there's barey any Cubans left in the hood. The cuban chains Sophie's and Tina's are better."

And this is ANOTHER let down by Guy from the places he checked out in New York. (But I don't blame him, he would never says anything is bad &with the competition in the Food Capital of NY, I'm sure he just wants to give low key places some publicity)So 2 food dish I'll point out :Oxtail Stew - we ordered this right after having this whole cuban oxtail stew obsession since coming back from our Miami trip, &well Puerto Sagua's cuban oxtail stew was that phenomenal that I guess I was wrong for hoping to seek that theirs would come close... But errr no. I mean it was alright.Ropa Vieja - this dish was so bland, and the meat was dry and chewy...The other accompaniments and dishes were... well, just not memorable enough at all.Maybe I should've ordered the arroz con pollo that Guy also reviewed... We just thought it'd be too much food and it takes awhile to be ready. Maybe there other stuff are winners? I don't know, I just know I wouldn't ever go to Queens again just for this when Brooklyn has low key Spanish joints that taste the same too and Queens have so many other better endless food options."

It is my boyfriend's favorite, too, so even if I don't order it, I will pick his, and taste it:) You can order Rincon Criollo as either entree or appetizer. When you order it, tell the wait staff to chop the chicken and add extra garlic sauce (or garlic sauce on the side). This is the best way to eat Rincon Criollo chicken,I think. I saw many groups were celebrating birthday here. If you tell the restaurant that you are celebrating a birthday, one of the wait staff( maybe he is a manager?) will bring a flan with a candle with happy birthday song. He wears funny glasses and after happy birthday song, he does funny dancing, too. We talked with him before, he was very friendly and told us his story how he moved to New York. I think the best way to enjoy this restaurant is going there in a group, and share different appetizers and try each others entree.* I am adding this after I posted the review, but I forgot to mention Rincon Criollo Appetizer.

The mariquitas were freshly made, but the mojo was a a bit too ""garlicky"" for my taste. I had the fish in garlic sauce with rice and beans and my husband had the chicken in garlic sauce with rice and beans as well. The rice and fish were cooked to perfection but the beans lacked flavor. We also had desert. I had the bunuelos they are small but very good. We also ordered a pitcher of so-called sangria, which is just a slice of orange and one maraschino cherry in each glass with straight up wine. No brandy, no juice, no real fruit, just wine. We felt duped.

We ordered the ham croquettes and yuca relleno squeezed a bit of lime onto it and they were gone in a minute! The ropa vieja is delicious the hubby had it with white rice and black beans. I ordered the Cuban sandwich because I've been craving one for a hot minute. It was authentic that first bite when you feel the crunch of the bread and then the layers of the sandwich was what a Cuban sandwich should taste like. Not dry, not soggy just perfection. My side of choice boiled yuca with a garlic sauce and sweet plantains! I love yuca especially fresh not frozen , it melted in my mouth the garlic sauce was just enough flavor not to be overpowering!

I must say this is one of my favorite top 5 restaurants in all of New York City. Fried pork chops, white rice, black beans, avocado and tomato salad, cafe con leche, and tres leches=HEAVEN ON EARTH. I can't wait to try the Paella next time (looks divine). Omelettes here have a lot of flavor. It is also very relaxing to come during the day. Weekends are busy and crowded but a ton of fun (especially if you are coming with family, friends for a birthday or special occasion). I would give this food establishment six stars if I could."

The walls are decorated with wooden plaques of Latin countries and historical motif. The food is classic stick to your ribs home cooking. We started with the grilled sausages that were flavorful and a good starter. Each main course comes with two sides. The rice with black beans side was called Moros y Cristianos which was an interesting name. The Tostones were freshly prepared and really good. The boiled Yuca was cooked in a very tasty garlic sauce. However, the yuca itself was a bit fibrous. For the main dish, I had the Ox Tails which were in a tomato based stew that was falling off the bone. The other dish we tried was the Shrimp Scampi that was baked in with a garlic butter sauce that was perfect in drizzling over the rice as well when eating.They have a very loud recording of a Happy Birthday song when you go and request that one of your party is celebrating a birthday there. It's quite fun and embarrassing if you weren't expecting it.I definitely have to come back and try other dishes on the menu."

My steak came out almost well done so that completely ruined the meal for me. My gf's was better but even she said that it was getting dry and tough as she ate more into her steak. Granted, we aren't at a steakhouse and we didn't order their traditional, well-acclaimed dishes, the temperature of the steak was just so off.The staff was pretty great though. We witnessed how they gave a birthday shout-out and it was the best I've seen done by a restaurant. The waiter who headlined it was very cheery and enthusiastic."

Been going to this restaurant as far back at the late 90's. I love their food. Ropa vieja is legendary. Arroz con pollo is as good as it gets. I really like their pork chops as well.

If you love coffee do not hesitate to try their cortadito, it is delicious.

Our waiter went over the entire menu, including all the specials for the day (he even brought out some food for my indecisive friend to try before ordering). The atmosphere was great and felt authentic. That food, though. A few of us ordered the chicharonnes, which I would highly recommend. The sweet plantains and red beans made for good sides. Had a Cuban style beer, which was good but overpriced at $7.If you're in Queens, and especially if you're near Junction, you have to try this authentic Cuban restaurant. I would definitely go back."

I got the Pechuga Rincon Criollo - grilled, thinly sliced, chicken breast topped with seared onions - with rice & beans and sweet plantains as sides. The chicken was  tasty, simply seasoned; however, oil just pooled at the center of my plate. Rice and beans were good, a tad too salty for my taste considering the flavoring of the chicken. On to the best part, my plantains were BURNT. Not slightly over-baked by several seconds, but burned to the point all I tasted was charred honey. I didn't send them back because... well I work in the food service industry and I just don't take risks...I did tell my server at the end of the meal, and asked him ""Wtf..."" (not in so many words) and all he said was ,""Oh, okay,"" and walked away to pack up our leftovers. Woohoo. Though I didn't expect a better answer considering we were in Corona...Probably won't be back. There are WAY better Cuban places to go in Queens... with normally cooked plantains!"

I'd cosign his ""Cuban Soul Food Restaurant."" That sums up this great little Cuban restaurant in Corona. My goal this month is to Yelp my way around the best food in Queens. And I, like many others found Rincon Criollo. It's not far off of Roosevelt Boulevard in Corona in a small non-descript shopping district. Parking was easy enough to find and inside was a pleasant surprise.There are pictures everywhere of Cuban folks. (Of course, the requisite one of the Queen (Celia Cruz) and many others. It has a look that must not have changed since the 1970s -- and that's a good thing. Intimate maybe, 20 feet wide.The service was excellent. They are helpful. One concern non-Spanish speakers can have is accessibility. (Learning Spanish bridges that gap.) But the wait-staff here were friendly and attentive and willing to explain.We had oxtails, ropa vieja, cafe con leche, mango milkshake and rice and black beans. Let me say as someone who makes and eats rice and black beans several times a week, that this was awesome here. Really just come for that. The cafe con leche was as I remembered and the bread was that Cuban bread that many imitate and few duplicate. Excellent.The oxtails were very good. I've had many, like many, many many. Although I am not a fan necessarily of the tomato sauce, the rest was awesome.I also had Ropa Vieja. This was decent but a little too salty for my taste. Decent but I've had slightly better.Of course the mango smoothy was as one would expect.The only downside was the drink menu. It was sparse. (I had a Presidente, but a Dominican beer in a Cuban place was not quite what I could have predicted.) Overall, the experience was excellent. Now those of use who are more diligent will see the Guy Fieri sign and worry. (I do everytime I see it.) Worry not. The FN has not ruined the place with lots of folks who are not palate particular.The other point is this feels like a warm diner. Like folks who know eachother. There's such a sweet spirit about this place that it seems like a perfect place to go to remember a happier time with some great food. And that really is it's own reward."

Oh man! I haven't had some of this stuff in so long. How could I deny myself the pleasure? :) Yeah, so I ordered a bunch of appetizers with some Spanish beer then finished off with some flan. Everything was perfect and the price was super cheap. They may not be converting to dollars or something, which is fine by me. This is just a simple old school restaurant without the loud music or glitz & glamour like some other Cuban places. I love it."

The diversity of foods just makes you forget about your passport and grab a metro card! Rincon Criollo is in a crazy busy part of Corona (which part isn't busy?). But its pretty much the best Cuban Restaurant I know in NY. (I don't know much, so take it as you will) Not only is the food great, but the service is pretty top notch! Not only are the servers attentive, but polite, amicable, and you're not limited to your 1 server but any of the servers in the restaurant. They all kinda just come by the table and ask if you need anything! (I posted a pic of one of the servers going ALL OUT, dancing, singing and shouting congratulating a couple on an anniversary dinner. They really make a scene of it!)The best part of the place is the food:The Chicharon de pollo is pretty much the overall winner so far. Hands down one of the best entrees in the place!If you're craving a little red meat at a great price, the Bistec rincon Criollo is pretty good. Good portion size, its not a Great steak (its pretty much flat and cooked well done) but its well flavored with the onions on top. The breaded pork chop cutlet was HUGE! Each entree comes with 2 sides.My favorites are the Sweet Plantains (maduros) and the Cassava in garlic sauceI hear the desserts are good, but there's always so much food I never have enough room for dessert!

One place representing the hood well is Rincon Criollo, known to many in foodieland as one of the (if not the) best real Cuban establishments in NYC. Despite never having been to Cuba and having only spent a little bit of time in Miami's Little Havana, my love for Cuban food has always remained strong. Rincon Criollo is, simply put, fantastic.From first impressions alone, this place doesn't look like much. The decor is undeniably old school - everything from the wall decor to the rickety dining furniture and generic table cloths. The waiters are a friendly bunch, usually extremely bilingual, a bit of a rarity in these parts.The food, especially when enjoyed within a group of people is almost always a feast of it's own. Fans of the famous Cuban dish ropa vieja, are sure to find a delectable version here. Stewed to perfection and deliciously tender, at $14 is a steal considering it comes with two sides. Another winner is the chicharon, it's practically fried chicken at it's juiciest and crispiest. The vaca frita is incredible, salty and juicy, a mesh of fried shredded beef with garlic has never been executed better. It just might be my favorite dish in the house.The sides are plentiful and really add to the meal. Moros y cristianos (rice and beans combo) and platano maduro (fried sweet plantain) are a killer combination with any entree. Even their papas fritas (fries) are good -  homemade, long and crispy, irregular but hearty. I would heed caution on the yuca con mojo (cassava with garlic sauce), a side that hasn't fared well with any of my dining companions, which means it's an acquired taste.Their menu is so vast that every visit has resulted in a new meal. I've heard such wonderful things about the rest of their food that it justifies more and more future visits to one of the best restaurants in Q-borough."

I do have to say I do love the food. In house service is great and friendly. Food is always good but now that they deliver on seamless I was excited to then be disappointed! They are not the cheapest and I don't mind paying a little extra for good food but why do they have to be sooo cheap with the portions! For the price they can give much better rations. Rice and maduros are usually inexpensive but you get so little. Let me say I'm speaking on behave of DELIVERY. Eating at the restaurant is nice and portions are good but I ordered multiple times now and for them to even charge a delivery fee on top of everything and short handing on sides for the price they charge is ridiculous to me. I will continue to eat there AT THE RESTAURANT but unfortunately will not order anything for delivery again.

The thing that got me the most was the culture and service. When we went it felt like we were automatically in a different country. While we were about to order it was someones birthday and they did a birthday song and celebration very different from most restaurants which made it very entertaining. The drinks were all white which was a little odd cuz he ordered lemonade and i ordered the papaya shake. They were dialed down but it was still pretty good. Not too sweet. We decided on this restaurant because i was craving sushi. So when we yelped it, it sent us here. I ordered the oxtail with avocado and sweet plantains while my friend got the sirloin steak with rice and beans with potatoes with garlic. The oxtail was a bit salty but woulda been nice with some carrots perhaps but honestly i've had better. His Sirloin Steak was good but even the medium rare felt over cooked. The sweet plantains were really good but they only gave five pieces. Where as the avocado they were really generous with but didn't taste ripe. The rice on beans was a compliment to the salty oxtail and the garlic potato we had a bite each and that was enough. Overall would I come here again, yes but will definitely have to try something new."

And her trademark shout of ""¡Azúcar!"" is appropriate for the one dish I enjoyed the most at this family eatery dating back to 1976: casco de Guayava con Queso , also known as Guava Shells with Cream Cheese. The english translation, mainly 'cream cheese' diminishes the appeal of this dish as I'm thinking Philadelphia brand and keyfood. Don't go there as this queso is nothing like something you'd find in a little gray tub.Our intrepid team of eaters, organized and led by Rachel A., occupied the center of a surprisingly empty restaurant for a Thursday night. We started with a plethora of appetizers, including codfish fritters, ham croquettes, cuban tamal, yucca and chorizo. We were also given sliced bread (average) and frequently refilled water. A pitcher of sangria was also shared.The chorizo was thinly sliced and not overwhelmingly salty. I enjoyed the tamal, a holiday yule-log shaped treat of masa. Our fleet of appetizers devoured, entrees were up next. I'd say that while the appetizer size was easily conducive towards sharing, the entrees, while large, weren't going to result in any seconds. There was also a small delay in the arrival of our oxtail that in no way detracted from the overall spread of Cuban treats.Beef liver steak with onions was my by far my favorite. Is it steak? Is it liver? Is it an odd fusion of the two concocted by a mad scientist? Large enough to be a steak but rich enough in iron to be moderately healthy, this one tender internal organ!For those seeking a unique birthday experience, the song and dance number performed will be quite memorable. Flashing lights and music are involved.Which brings us back to where we started, mainly with mention of guava. I actually had expected the guava shell dessert to be a pastry as I've had such treats in the past. (At the now defunct Puerto Rico Cafe in the Newport Mall long, long ago). Instead I was presented with actual shells of the guava in syrup and an amazing queso that I could eat without any additional accompaniment.The split of the bill came to exactly $20 per person which, for the quality and quantity of food was perfectly fair. I spotted a cuban sandwich that might have to be tried next time.Rincon Criollo is only a few feet from the 7 train and will be featured on an upcoming episode of Drivers, Drive-Ins and Dives. Guy Fieri and Celia Cruz, under the same roof, in a corner of classic Cuban Corona, that's Rincon Criollo."

The portions are HUGE! I got exhausted after the first pork chop, and the second one was an uphill battle for sure!Their plaintain side dish was a bit soggy so I was indifferent to it. My glass was never empty because they always made rounds to refill waters. This is rare for me because I drink a TON of water. It was the first time I had Spanish food and this place did not disappoint!"

I came here on a Saturday night and the place was packed. It only took about 20 min to get a table for two. I ordered the roasted half chicken with rice and beans(cooked together) and sweet plantains....with a glass of sangria. My love ordered the snapper that was cooked in garlic and white wine with rice and beans. EVERYTHING WAS DELICIOUS! If I could eat here everyday I would.The service was also amazing. Everyone was extremely friendly and attentive (which is rare in NYC.)This is a restaurant that you have to try out if you're in the area! PS- the only credit card they accept is AMEX!

The service was great but the food was just mediocre. Same chicken, rice and beans I can get anywhere else. Don't get the Cuban. It's a thin panini lacking all the goodness it should contain.

Sadly I was super disappointed and left all of my food behind. I ordered the steak with onions and the rice with beans , my mom ordered the shrimp omelet and cassava . Everything lacked flavor and they didn't have any sauces. I'm pretty disappointed cause that was my cheat meal and a complete waste of calories. The rice lacked flavor , the beans lacked flavor, the steak lacked flavor, the shrimp omelet lacked flavor. The cod fritters were very fishy, but with enough lime were OK. The chorizo was OKAY.

Toasted bread, meats galore, the flavors in your mouth and the textures is unimaginable. If they tossed in an egg and avocado.. I would have been in heaven. The smoke Chops. Was something different. It looks like chops, but It taste just like ham! Oh how tricky they can be! My favorite dish was the Chicharron Pollo. Was probably the best. I can eat that with rice. All day! and of course the best for last. The Seafood and Meats Paella was amazing. Make sure if your want to order that. Order it first. It takes about 45 mins to an 1 hr.

They use a sandwich press to get it flat warm and toasty. The tender ham wasn't overly salty and wasn't rubbery at all. The enjoyed the meltiness of the Swiss that masked the slightly dry pernil.  The neutral flavor of the mustard was subtle and lacked the extra kick of spiciness the sandwich desperately needed. I suspected the sandwich wouldn't be big enough to satisfy my appetite so I also ordered myself a $3 tamale. The pleasantly airy consistency tamale was above average, but I was hoping for more of the filling. I managed to find one tiny piece of pernil hiding in the corner. However, I appreciated the toasty floury corny flavor which warmed up the inside of my belly.Tip: if you are dining in and you tell them it is your friend's birthday, a waiter will do an over the top performance while bringing out a complimentary birthday flan. The flan was the best I've ever had."

I'm surprised it took me so long to go to this place. Food is usually delicious and tasty. Depending on what night you go there can be a wait. Go on an off night and there won't be much of a wait.

I won't name the place but the food is better, the price is comparable, the staff are Cuban, they play live latin music, and they have a Cuban guy rolling cigars all night (hint: it's located on Thompson street and shares the same name as the country).  We shared the chicken broiled in garlic sauce and the ropa veija (which is a standard in testing Cuban restaurants)!  For sides we had beans mixed with rice, plain rice, fried plantains and fried sweet plantains.  The food was ok but not amazing.  My sister went to Miami a week earlier and went to a tiny authentic Cuban restaurant and thought the food was much better there.  The ropa veija was really soggy and oily but did still have good flavor.  The broiled chicken was pretty good but was so salty that it was hard to eat after going half way through.  The fried plantains were perfect!  And the sweet plantains were good but they were a little too mushy and not as sweet as I would have liked.  Good part was there were leftovers to eat the next day! Also, I did not know Guy Fieri went here! I took a pic of his marking :-)!"

And a dancing celebration on your birthday. This is one of our staple restaurants. The food is no frills, and delicious. The vaca frita has a cult following, as it should because it's crispy garlicky deliciousness. We always go on slow nights because once we're in, we want nothing standing in the way of our food. I've tried many dishes and have lobed every one of them. I haven't tried the paella yet, but I plan to the next time we visit. The plantains are magical, the fried chicken is juicy, and crispy, and the desserts are just the perfect ending. The staff is attentive and sweet as can be. This place feels like family.

You know the style very bright lights, Latin Music, pictures of music stars from past generations plastered on the walls, waiters wearing short sleeve white shirts with a bow tie. All good and very kitschy.Service was very good with lots of Teamwork. Quick arrival of waiter on initial visit to the table. Attentive throughout the meal experience. Funny. Very solid old school service. Chicharron de polloThe chicken was crispy and flavorful, but just OK. It was not golden brown and moist, but very dark and dry. Masitas de puercoSame as chicken. Nice texture, but just OK. Again, dark in color, but not as dry.The sides had potential, but again very average. Yuca was tasty, but overdone. Moro rice was not hot. Maduros and tostones again just average.AMEX and Cash only.Overall, I found the food to have potential, but it was just a notch or two below what I expected it to be. I grew up eating chicharron de pollo, masitas de puerco, yuca, tostones, etc. The quality was just not there. I had the feeling that the food was the end of day leftovers. Will I be back, YES. The overall feeling of Rincon Criollo was very welcoming. I just need to be there earlier than 9 PM."

Only complaint about the decor was a Guy Fieri stenciled graffiti on the wall. What a d-bag.Anyway, the menu was full of things that sounded amazing. I finally decided on the pollo a la carrera (chicken on a run), and it was great. For $12, you get half a chicken overed in olives, onions and a tasty brown sauce. I was also surprised that it came with two sides. What a great deal! I had it with beans and rice (mixed together) and fried potatoes (which were really just french fries).My friends ordered the chicken and rice for two, and it came in a really big metal pot covered with a towel. It was yellow rice and baked pieces of chicken (I assume a whole one, since there was so much). I tried some of it, and it was pretty good as well. Definitely worth the hype.Go to Rincon Criollo!Note that the only credit card they accept is American Express, which is a bummer."

Been here way too many times. Stumbled upon this place from Yelp Reviews and have religiously visited this place for any special event in my life ( graduation, post elopement , birthdays, etc). Apart from the amazing food ( my particular favorite would have to be el rabo encendido ), is the service. I always try to go when Rudy is there as he is the most animated and lively person in there. I secretly like to always say it is someone's birthday just to see the lights dine and have him wear the hat and sing/dance ! Not sure why it is only cash/amex, but! it must be a good sign. Each entree come with two sides and its always best to get different sides if going with a group to be a nibble here and there of different sides. Always ask how the avocado is for the day. They are honest and will tell you whether they are buttery or not ( hey! everyone has their preference). And take the time to ask the gentlemen about the history of the place. If i am feeling gluttonous and get an appetizer, I ALWAYS get the yucca rellena ( yuca roll). Amazingly crispy on the outside, moist and seasoned beef in the inside. Pairs well with some hot sauce. And great to wash down with their homemade lemonade. skip the bread to make room for everything. Best times to go would be week days and weekends before 6pm. The good thing about this place is that they actually let you enjoy your food ! In saying that, they will not rush you. So if you are waiting for a table, they don't ever try to guestimate nor do they do the distasteful check drop off mid way into your desert. Its a very lax waiting period for tables, so be patient."

My spouse's family is Cuban - we just traveled to Cuba in 2012/2013 on a *family visa* and stayed w/ relatives (i.e. pre-Obama announcement - we could travel freely throughout the country on buses - without the requisite chaperoned guided tour that is required of US citizens who travel via a special ""tourist"" visa). We celebrated Christmas, New Years, Honeymoon there and I finally tasted proper yuca with lime...  Batida de Mamey (!!), amazing fresh pressed guava juice (that can only be compared to the same in India). My spouse's abuela is in her mid-90's, still spunky and lives in Queens. She, along w/ spouse's parents (who grew up in Habana and NYC) trust Rincon Criollo - not just for their authenticity and quality of food - but also due to the family that runs the restaurant. They personally know their customers and have been a staple of Cuban food for emigrants since the 1970's, where they brought the recipes over from the island. We have been going there for abuela's birthday pretty much every year. As you may know Cubans basically swim in pork and lard... and I'm a pescatarian. However, in Cuba, there is actually a lot of fish/seafood served - and same with Rincon Criollo. INSIDER TIP: On Monday they serve the Tamal en Cazuela - abuela dreams of this and we have had to plan our schedules for Monday dinners so she could eat this (and of course others were required to eat it as well :-) ). Although there is meat in it, I once took a sip of the broth out of respect for abuela and it was REALLY complex and lovely.My Favorites (In no particular order): 1) Mariquitas - They are a must order. Specifically because the mojo that is served alongside them is SO on point, garlicky and spicy at the same time. You can't easily find mariquitas like this in NYC (I have tried and to this day, nothing compares),2) Frituras de Bacalao: These cod fritters are perfectly fried and have a great ratio of chunky fish in them. Read: They are not overly bread-y. Sometimes, I just order this as my main meal. 3) Maduros: Very well made. 4) Tostones: I put it on here, because they are better than usual for *restaurants*. HOWEVER, my spouse makes the absolute best tostones that I have ever had (even better than his family in Cuba). It is his family recipe passed down... 4) Bunuelos 5) Flan de Leche: Again, not the best (because that would be homemade). But extraordinary for restaurant flan.6) Cafe con Leche: You must finish off your meal w/ a proper Cuban coffee.TAKEAWAY:If you live in another borough - it is *definitely* worth the trek to Queens.

By far the best I've ever had and I've had my share of braised meats. The sauce was rich and sticky and perfectly seasoned. The best way to relish it is to eat it with white rice, which is what I did. The meat was fatty and falling off the bone, just the way I like it. And while it may look like a big dish, the actual amount of meat isn't a lot, which is a good thing because it IS fatty and a small amount really fills you up. I don't live in the neighborhood but decided to check out this place enroute to CT from LGA based on recommendations on Yelp. Thanks fellow Yelpers. You were spot on.

The Stuffed Cassava was the only dish that was a-ok but nothing extraordinary.I told our waiter that our appetizers were less than satisfactory. He was nice and recommended that we try the ""Ropa Vieja"" and he assured us that we would enjoy it.$16 for the rather small dish of Ropa Vieja was a bit too expensive. The beef was SO salty and the dish was mainly just tomato sauce.I'm sad to say that not even 1 out of the 4 dishes that I've tried was satisfactory.

These people don't take reservations so my son and I got there around quarter to 7:00 and ended up waiting nearly an hour. We also made the mistake of not checking in with anyone so they could add us to the wait list. As a result, we waited an extra 15 minutes or so while a couple who came after us were seated. Once we were seated, however, the service was fast and the food was fantastic. My son convinced me to try the chorizo and I liked it somewhat although I rarely eat sausage (or pork for that matter). I had the oxtail which was wonderfully tender and my son had shredded beef, which he really enjoyed. The tres leches cake was amazing. I don't think I've had anything like it, with a bottom layer soaked in syrupy sweetness.The place has a really nice family atmosphere too. The owner seems to know many customers and there's a whole musical number and dance for people's birthdays.

My girlfriend and I spontaneously walked into this spot, and only had a limited amount of cash and didn't know that they only accept American express. So we wasn't able to try their infamous seafood/chicken paellas. But we did get to try their other dishes. For appetizers, we had the cod fritters and the rincon criollo platter dish. The cod fritters were not bad, it tasted like seasoned bacalao but fried. The rincon criollo appetizer is like a sample platter which consisted of pernil, ham, spanish sausage, cheese, and olives. The pernil was okay but the ham and Spanish sausage were pretty good. Every entree comes with two sides of your choice which is pretty nice. I had the fish filet dish which was cooked and seasoned nicely. My sides were rice and a side of black beans which were okay. My girlfriend had the oxtail with the rice and beans along with cassava in garlic seasoning. The portions for the oxtail was pretty big and chunky. The seasonings were okay, maybe because I prefer the dominican/Puerto Rican style. The rice and beans had chunks of pork in it which they said it was bacon, I didn't really like the chunks of pork because they didn't taste fresh to me. But their garlic sauce (garlic minced/puree with oil) actually went really well with our dishes and made it taste better. The atmosphere is very causal and cheerful. But their service was excellent. We happened to be there when a big family was celebrating someone's bday and the way they brought in the cake with the music was very cute and little different compared to other restaurants. The only downside is that they don't accept any major credit cards but American express... Overall, the food was good and would definitely come back again to try their paellas, especially since we live nearby!FYI. We were told that the paella will take at least an hour to have ready."

I don't think the chicken was breaded, and so it just had a thin layer of crust/crunch on the outsideeach entree came with a side dish, therefore one entree was plenty of food.Also, be sure to come here on your birthday, I don't want to ruin it for anyone but it's a pretty nice show.If I am craving decently priced and tasty cuban food I will definitely return."

I tried hard to engage some of the waitresses by asking them about the restaurant, and my daughter was dressed up like Little Red Riding Hood -- cute as a button!  Nobody even cracked a flicker of a smile.Foodwise, Zum Stammtisch had some nice high points which could've been improved even higher.  In general, the food is very good.Table Bread: A+Was warmed and delicious.  Crust was crusty.  Inside was soft and fluffy.  Perfect bread.Goulash Soup: A-Delicious.  Slightly too liquidy for me, but the flavor was out of sight.  You can see the flavor by just looking at my picture.  The portion was bigger than expected.  I was almost full just by the soup!Split Pea Soup: AThis is a homogeneous split pea.  There are no split peas or split pea chunks.  It leans more towards ""soup"" than ""stew"".  I'm not saying it's thin, because it's not.  It was put through a food blender, so there are no split peas to chew.  I would've given this soup an A+, but it had hotdog cut up into it.  The hotdog was ok, but seems like an odd choice for a German restaurant.  Why hotdog?!?  how about nicely grilled sausage chunks?  Or more traditional grilled ham chunks?Bratwurst: A-Knockwurst: A-Krainerwurst: A-The sausages were wonderful.  Unfortunately, considering this is a German restaurant, they SHOULD HAVE been perfect, but they weren't.  They were all very tasty and fresh, but I had two problems with them.  First, they weren't grilled consistently.  One side had grill marks; the other side didn't, and perhaps wasn't cooked enough (yikes).  Second, all three sausages either had gristle or weren't cooked enough.  I'm hoping it was gristle because I don't relish the idea of eating under-cooked pork, but either way, that's why I'm giving the sausages an A- instead of an AThe potato and sauerkraut that comes with the sausages were very good.  I felt the potato could've been better; it was a tad dry, and could've used onions and garlic, but with mustard, and accompanying sauerkraut, was good.  Table mustard was excellent.Sauerbraten: CSweet flavor, which I'm not overly fond of, but the bigger sin is that it was as dry as the Sahara on a hot day.  Criminally overcooked and not a gram of fat to be seen.  I did not enjoy this dish.Jägerschnitzel: A-A fun dish: a breaded veal cutlet with mushroom gravy and home fries.  Delicious.  The breading is wonderful.  Maybe slightly too many mushrooms, but the mushroom gravy was fantastic!  I don't normally complain about price, but $30 for a breaded veal cutlet with mushroom gravy seems a bit ridiculous.  Doesn't change the fact that this dish is delish!Coffee: ANew York is the only city I've ever been to where you can pay $100 for a lunch and get crappy coffee.  What is wrong with this city?!?  Happy to report that the coffee at Zum Stammtisch is excellent.  We got 2 refills.  Nice!  And kudos on the good coffee!Eier Eis: A-Nice quality ice cream, but a more high-quality ""vanilla bean"" type ice cream would've made this excellent dessert perfect. You get 3 scoops of vanilla, and just the right amount of liquor... not too overpowering, but not leaving you wanting for more.  Good way to end a meal."

I used to go here when I worked in Ridgewood many years ago, and have occasionally trekked out there ever since.The atmosphere is second to none! Seriously; animal heads, thick carved wooden beams, knitted cloth placemats, and friendly servers wearing dirndls. Then the food comes along and KAPLOW! It is stupendous, generous, and always fresh. I had Sauerbraten yesterday after a herring appetizer. My friend got the Goulash. Both were incredibly delicious.They start you off by dropping a mini loaf of bread on a little cutting board on your table, with a knife stuck right into the loaf. Beers are frothy, fresh, and remain cold in stonewear steins.If you like German restaurants, this is an absolute must-visit. Most places in the city are predominantly sausage & beer gardens.

From that moment on, I knew this was the real deal and was super excited.My husband and I came here on a Friday night for dinner. It was busy, but not super crowded. The menu appears to line up with what I have seen in my travels through Germany.Overall, the food tasted pretty authentic and was complete with large German portions! My husband ordered the bratwurst and knockwurst with home fries. The waitress brought mustard over for him; I was excited to have some of the sweet and spicy mustard like in the Hofbrauhaus. Too bad it was standard brown mustard. His dish was good, but I enjoyed mine more. I ordered the veal cordon bleu (comes with home fries) with a side of purple cabbage. I loved how cheesy my dish was -- it was dripping out and some cheese was even toasted in the fryer as it leaked out! The breading was thin and crispy. On the whole the dish was salty, creamy, and crunchy. I quite enjoyed it.My husband and I had a great dining experience. I would definitely come back to experience a bit of Germany in the U.S. Next time, we'll have to try some beer!"

My parents grew up coming to Zum Stammtisch when my grandparents lived in Ridgewood, and they carried that tradition forward when my sister, cousins and I were growing up. Prior to this most recent visit, it had been years since I visited Zum Stammtisch, but I'm happy to say that this place still delivers quality, both in terms of food and service.To start with the basics, Zum Stammtisch is a traditional German restaurant. In fact, the German derivation of the name means ""family table"". The inside of the restaurant almost feels like a combination of a tavern and a German hunting lodge, featuring dark wood furniture, rustic lighting, and Bavarian decor.Service here is also top notch. Our server was attentive, knowledgeable, and very service-oriented. We were here to visit my uncle's birthday, so she also offered to take several pictures of us and made sure they were ""social media worthy"".Finally, let's talk about the food. My family is very predictable in the sense that we all crave Sauerbraten (call it a family tradition). Sauerbraten is not easy to make (it takes days) and it's quite simple to screw up (much like slow-roasted southern style brisket). Nevertheless, Zum Stammtisch doesn't fail to deliver. The sauerbraten is tender (can cut with a fork) and covered with sweet-and-sour gravy. The side of red cabbage and dumplings (traditional for this dish) are also made perfectly here. In addition, every meal begins with free bread service (so good), and the beverage selections are on point (plenty of German beers and lots more to choose from).There's not many of these places left, so I'm glad Zum Stammtisch is still around. It's a classic German restaurant that focuses on service, food quality, and family. If you love German food, this place is a must. If you don't like German food, this place might convince you otherwise."

They are also very well known for their prime rib!  From what people tell me, it is the best around by far!I have always had good service here.  The staff has always been very friendly.  Ive never had any issues.  One of the organizations I am part of has their Christmas party her every year, and I am looking forward to it this Thursday!!!They also have a great German deli right next door!All in all, its in the middle of nowhere with horrible parking.  Its hard to get tom but it is totally worth it!!!"

I can't say it's authentic because I've never been to Germany unless you count EPCOT. Lets get this review started!If I'm going to Queens, there's no better foodie wingman than Yelper Jim D. My grandmother would have loved to feed him, the man can eat! I made plans with him a few weeks ago. I got to the restaurant first, there is one thing about Queens, it's hipster free. Guys at the bar all drinking some quality German beer, no kale chips here. I nudge my way to the bartender, I don't know what the hell to order but I see a guy drinking a Pilsner. I tell the bartender I'll have one of those. A few minutes later, Jimmy D shows. Guy back slaps happen and we're shown to our table.Now I've been reading the website, I know I'm going to order the Wienerschnitzel. Now Jim is in his element, he starts telling the waitress bring gold flass (?), beers and potato pancakes. That is a lotta food and all the while I'm thinking I have to drive back to Stony Brook.Some amazing bread is brought to our table. I'm trying not to go into a carb overload but the bread is really good. Jim & I are talking, I can see my buddy is in a good mood. I always say, happy wife gets you a happy life. He's in the zone, teaching me about Gold water and how the Jagerschnitzel gravy needs to be on the side so it doesn't get soggy. I would have put mozzarella on this thing, who knew?!I see my Yelp buddy Tonya J has a Yelp ROTD here, I'm excited for what's coming. I'm now staring at the massive plate with a Jagerschnitzel hanging over the side?? I'm about to cut into it, Jim D plops a potato pancake on my plate. This is German food at its finest. The Jagerschnitzel? Krazy good. What I was most impressed with was the potato pancake. It was so good and crunchy! We had one left over, I wanted my wife to experience how awesome the food was at Zum. I can see why people love this spot, this is great German cooking, Queens baby!I can't believe I ate everything. Now Jim? He's itching for more. He orders coffee, no problem. Then he asks for a dessert menu? Jim.. Baked goods are my weakness! I also order the famous apple strudel. Growing up in Brooklyn, I had my share of Strudel. This strudel takes it to another level. The shell was very light, unlike what I had my entire life. This was a well executed and perfectly crafted strudel. The apples were very fresh, nothing out of a can from these folks.Will I return? Of course but it's a hike for me. If you want to experience the Best German food in the area? Zum Stammtisch is the spot."

The live music / entertainment was a fantastic touch. So much fun. I can't speak enough about the servers, who encourage pulling you out of your chair to dance. It's all good.

In Big Jim's opinion it's the Best German restaurant in the area. I've been going to this wonderfully authentic spot for over 30 years. The place is always exactly the same every time I visit. The bar is the same, the tables and the decorations haven't changed and the menu I have memorized. I was really delighted when Mayor Bill suggested that we meet here for Zums for lunch. My friend didn't know that I've been coming here with friends since my college days. The place has so many memories of my youth and Good Times. I can see memories of dear friends passed on.., still at the bar here drinking and enjoying the times. I guess In Heaven There Is No Beer, that's why they're still all here ..It was a wonderful homecoming to return and great to see my Cool Yelp friend Bill.I love the Jagerschnitzel here. I mean it's Big Jim's favorite meal for a reason. It's just so Big, crispy and the best I've had anywhere. I get their mushroom hunter sauce on the side and then dip, keeps every bite crisp and delish. For appetizer of course we got Zumies famous homemade potato pancakes. Served with sour cream and applesauce, I can taste them now so hot freshly-made . A must order, these potato pancakes are off the chart. We got a good German beer to pair on meal with, and then Billy and I toasted good times with the  incredibly lavish 22 karat Goldwasser liquor shots. This is a serious shot Folk's, as it's actually flakes of gold floating around in the liquor. Prost and bottoms up. And let's have another round.  Next up coffee and dessert, I had the incredibly delicious Black Forest sundae and my friend Bill enjoyed his light crispy apple strudel.The Goldwasser made our meal even better, getting lit up with the local folks in the cool German Bavarian atmosphere. Our server was just wonderful prompt with water refills, and was wonderfully attentive to all our needs. We had such a good time at the Zum Stammtisch for lunch this afternoon Thanks to my friend The Yelp Baron Mayor Bill( ..That's his Yelp title).. for making the suggestion we meet here. I've always loved it at Zumies.I can't wait to return here, there's a reason this is my favorite German eating and drinking joint. See you all again soon. Moin-moin Friends!"

Everything is largely portioned so come hungry."

This intrigued me because you don't see a straight-up German restaurant on just any street corner. My only real experience with German food was when I was in Disney World at Biergarten, so when I had the opportunity to try Zum myself, I pounced.Zum has been in Glendale since the 70s; in addition to the restaurant, they have a shop next door where they sell meats and such. You can tell the restaurant has been around for a while, but aesthetically speaking they really did an amazing job. Zum definitely screams German restaurant with its dark color scheme and little details everywhere. The aesthetics spill into the menu - they really have a nice variety of dishes, all with roots in Germany or Germanic/Nordic countries. We were started with two substantial loaves of bread and butter - I'm not sure exactly what kind of bread it was but I was tasting some sweet and rye notes. Whatever it was, I was enjoying the carbs. I also decided to get a cup of goulash; this was really good - lots of chunks of beef and filled with flavor, it was delicious. We all shared käsespätzle, which was a good idea because it was super rich. Despite the richness, I really enjoyed it - the noodles, the cream, the bacon...I mean, come on.For my main I decided to get sausages. One of the options was to get a choice of three sausages with sides of sauerkraut and potato salad. I chose one of each sausage they offered: bratwurst, knockwurst, and krainerwurst. Each one had really good flavor and complimented each other well while also holding their own - I'm glad I chose one of each. The sauerkraut was good, but the real side dish star for me was the potato salad. It wasn't mayo-based which I liked and had a slight acidity which worked well with the dish overall. Really the only sour spot for me was when dessert came and they were out of black forest cake. Normally I'm okay with out of stock issues, but to be out of a signature German dessert on a Friday evening? mmmm :-/. We did however get the apple strudel which kind of made up for it - it had nice cinnamon and apple flavor. Service was great, everyone was really friendly and service was prompt. Overall, Zum was a fun treat. The food was honest and delicious, plus the aesthetics were on point. I would definitely come back and recommend this place to friends. A trip to their pork store is on my radar, so perhaps a revisit will be sooner rather than later =)"

We drove by months before actually stepping foot in here and I remember saying, ""that has to be a German place."". Inside is larger than you might think. You only see one room of two when you go inside. Tucked behind the bar is another larger room with plenty of tables and chairs. The menu here is meat and beer. Okay they also offer salmon but are you really ordering that? I went with the light beer (even though I also tasted and enjoyed the dark beer). Yes, they do boots here. No, we did not use them. Yes, I got a big ass mug of beer that required two hands to hold to take one sip. For my meal I had the breaded chicken. The food was okay, nothing too great but I also find German food in general to be on the bland side. The service here is what really bumps this place to 4 stars.

German food remains to be my least liked food. I'm going on my opinion and that of my friends.  Was looking forward to one of those big warm pretzels. It was only 7PM and they ran outI stay safe with the wursts. They were good with the hot sauerkraut but the potato salad was cold and it's usually served warm which makes it so so much better. The other dishes were smothered in gravy or sauces. My friend said the sauerbraten wasn't great. I tasted it and the meat was so potted that it was mush in your mouth. If you have no teeth this is the dish for you!!The pork chop was dry as anything as you can see in the pic. Best part---- desert. Hot apple strudel with vanilla ice cream. Asked for whipped cream but never came. At least they make decaf coffee which a lot of restaurants don't. Good bread on the table to start. Service was good. Wouldn't go back. Parking is pretty difficult. No lot.

The waitresses are dressed in traditional clothing,  the decor is dark, rustic and filled with blue checkerboard. The food is delicious and consistent. The goulash soup is my absolute favorite and as good as my grandmother makes it. Even the free brown bread they serve is fresh, authentic and tasty. The sausage platters are huge and also tasty as are the sauerbraten and chicken dishes. The portions are very large and can be shared. Also: beer  is a great way to compliment your meal.

It really is like stepping into little Germany in NYC! Service is so warm and homely and the staff are so knowledgeable about the food and beers. They're also dressed up (some of them) in traditional Bavarian attire. I had the veal cutlet which was cooked to perfection and my wife had the shrimp special which she wasn't to keen on. The bread basket they give you as appetizers is off the hook! So fresh and tasty for a bread basket and the flight of beer we ordered was so great. To end we had the black forest slice which was a nice generous helping (as if we needed more after such a wholesome meal?!) definitely one of the greats in this area!!!!

If you want to try authentic German cuisine, you must visit!! I have tried a variety of food from here including the Jaegerschnitzel, brats, and steak tar tar. Steak tar tar might just be my favorite. It is ground steak meat that is served raw in pieces on a thin bread, and paired with potato salad in the middle. I was a bit weary because of the ""raw"" part, but it absolutely seasoned to perfection and has become a staple! You also must have the ground pepper garnished on top! There's really nothing like it and in my opinion is a very unique dining choice!There are also a variety of other dishes to try that are true to German tradition, however the 3 i named are my favorite. You can also choose appetizers, desserts, and specials that change daily. The lunch menu is also the same as the dinner menu.Try to get there early for lunch or make reservations for dinner. This place fills up fast on the weekends, as it is a popular place for locals! Parking can be difficult, as there's only side street parking. However, of you do go for lunch or on a week day you'll have better luck getting a spot. If you're in the mood to try something different or you're already a fan of German food, this is an absolute must try!!!!!"

Hey, if you're really interested in having a good Schnitzel (veal cutlet) then you're in for a treat. Having said that, I have to say that the entire menu was very authentic. Spätzle prepared with cheese that is melted in a crock is a nice starter! But do couple that with a good Pilsner beer! For the meat lovers I highly recommended the Sauerbraten which is prepared perfectly, and served swimming in a pool of gravy. This you can couple with your choice of Knödels (German Dumplings) where you are served two, or mashed potatoes or a vegetable! Whatever you couple it with, the Sauerbraten remains the star of the dish. If you're into sausages, there is a good assortment here, and they have a plate where you can try most in one serving. My entire party was very happy with their meals and the service is absolutely great! If you're not familiar with German food, or if you are, you will enjoy your experience here. And don't forget the apple strudel for dessert! They also have a German pork shop next door, where you can get some sausages to take home and a good collection of German Edibles like marzipan! Worth a trip!"

I have been going here my whole life and I can't think of a better place to spend time with family and friends. Make dinner reservations ,but come early and spend time at the bar. The beer is awesome. I can't say enough about the food here. You have to get the goulash soup for an appetizer and the jager schnitzel for entree. The meat is cooked soo well and the veal cutlet is huge. The hunters sauce is one of the best sauces I have ever had. If I had to select a last meal this place would be it. This place is a family tradition to me. Can't say enough good things about it. Check out the porkStore. I hear they have an online business now. I would give this place 6 stars if able."

We reserved a space in the back and were hoping to get to 20 people for their set menu. We asked if we could just have the set menu (which was a choice of an appetizer, entree, dessert, and coffee for $35 a person). Definitely a great deal as their portions are gigantic here!I split the entrees with a couple of people, so I ordered the jargerschnitzel, another ordered the beef dish, and the last person ordered the sausage option. The jaegerschnitzel was definitely the winner, and apparently is their most popular/signature dish. I requested the sauce to be on the side, as I still wanted some extra crispy portions of the schnitzel, but this was given to another person at the table. Either way, even with the mushroom sauce covering it, it still maintained a nice level of crispness. It was honestly perfection!The beef dish was in a sauce that was a bit too sweet for my taste, so I wouldn't recommend this, and the sausage option was pretty meh.The cheesecake was really, really tasty! The staff handled our huge group pretty easily and were joking around with su the whole time.The other thing I'd like to tough on is their beer flight - this was not your average flight with 4 oz. pours, their pours were about 8 oz. each! By the end of the meal, I was stuffed from the food, and the amount of liquids I drank, as I got a half liter of hefeweizen even before we ate. An absolutely wonderful, friendly German place, and one that I'd go back to frequently if it wasn't so far from me!"

This was always our favorite German Restaurant and would travel 1.5 hrs each way from NJ in traffic just to eat here.  This past visit on Saturday 8/10 was so awful I don't think we will ever go back.  Service was fine but Food was so awful we wondered if they sold the place or got a new chef.  Such a shame.  Their food and desserts were always so phenomenal that no other German place could compete.  Don't know what happened. ‍

The food is decent. My favorite is the jaegar schnitzel. The ghoulash is also good. I went recently with a group and was turned off however by the service. Additionally the server charged us $2.50 for every refill of soda. She could have mentioned it, I don't recall seeing it on the menu. Usually we get beer, but this night in particular we wanted soda. Imagine our surprise when we see an extra $20 on the bill for soda! It's from a fountain anyway, you can literally see the station from the front entrance. The experience definitely put a bad taste in my mouth."

I remain a vegetarian, Grandma is 6 years older, and the Zum Stammtisch still doesn't know how to take care of its customers. My family had dinner here this week. The portions were huge (they seem to have increased since we were last here), the food was delicious, and our server Megan was great. There were even potato pancakes available, and if you've read my previous review, you understand why that's really something to celebrate. The trouble came with the bill. We had spent nearly $300 on food and drinks. Imagine our dismay when we discovered that my uncle had been charged $3.95 for the 4 ounces of extra gravy he asked for with his Jagerschnitzel. We thought this was ridiculous, and brought it to the manager's attention. He was very apologetic and asked what he could do to make us happy. Did we want him to remove the charge? Nope. We wanted it to never be on the bill in the first place! Was the $4 worth annoying otherwise happy customers? This restaurant needs to change its nickeling and diming ways. We will never be back, and that's a shame because the potato pancakes were worth the 6 year wait."

Give this gal a raise - she deserves it!"

You can't go wrong with the goulash soup, herring salad, sauerbraten, jJägerschnitzel or any of the wursts. All are still top notch. Sip a big stein of beer while you munch.

Whatever...goulash? Really? Well, I'm from Arizona. I know goulash is that dish your mother makes; a casserole with pasta and Veg-all. Well, German goulash is not what my mother used to make. Zum Stammtisch goulash is a little bit of heaven in a bowl. The worst part: I was sharing a bowl. This was my fault because of pre-complaining that I didn't like goulash, so, only one bowl was ordered.  Everything we ordered was exceptional. The service was great! The ambiance was nice. This will be my go-to when I'm in NYC. I'm sure there are other places just as good, but this was love at first bite! I would recommend it without apprehension."

However, I had not eaten there in well over 10 years and learned that it's long time competitor in the area, Niedersteins, is no longer in business. Anyway, I happen to be in the area with a friend so we stopped in, not knowing Oktoberfest what is happening. This is a prefix event that apparently sells out long in advance. Nice Octoberfest style ambience with live music. However, since we were not part of that, we had to wait half an hour for a table, which ended up not being too bad because people watching was great. My friend agreed that the way it was well worth while, we had a great time and the authentic German food was excellent. If you're not sure what to order, try the Bauern Platte and get the beer sampler. Despite the über busy night they were having, the staff were still friendly and attentive."

Pat was the bartender and everything about him was great.

We started off the with 2, 1 liter house beers. I don't directly remember the names but one was the wheat beer the other Lauger. I had the Lauger and it was amazing. My friend had ordered the 2 sausages. Knockwurst and Krainerwurst. A rating for both. I had gotten the Jagerschnitzel. That's their coveted dish. Served with cabbage, Mushroom sauce on top of Veal cutlet and home fries with bacon. I was blown away. I didn't get the coffee they offer but based off other reviews they say it's amazing.

Wiener Zwiebel Rostbraten was purely fat, not a steak. Literally all you could taste was fat. On top of that, the onion was covered in dark burn. That dish was huge, barely finished it, but just GREASE. Second dish, that we ordered was Sirloin Steak, medium rare. Very juicy, tender, but no FLAVOR. Same thing, steak was literally burned. All I could taste was bitter flavor of burn on this steak. No use of SALT/PEPPER/GARLIC/THYME/BUTTER to make this nice piece of meat stand out. The only thing that we enjoyed were the steak fries and beer flight. Total cost was $97. With tip, $112. I mean for such a price, not a visit worth of going. I hope, the rest of their dishes is not that poorly executed."

My dad took me here tonight before flying back to Tampa after Christmas. There was an hour long wait, but it was worth it! This place is very small and popular so if you have a party of 4 or more, you should make a reservation. We arrived around 5:30pm and did indeed wait an hour for our party of four. The building is very old and I don't think that the decor has changed at all since it opened many many years ago. There is not a ton of seating, but they do have a small bar area to hang out at while you wait. There are maybe 10 barstools and plenty of long benches along the walls to sit with your German beer. There is a full liquor bar as well. If you want a true neighborhood bar experience, you'll enjoy this place. The food is really the best part of coming here. Amazing German classics like wienerschnitzel, jaegerschnitzel, sauerbraten, brats, weisswurst, knockwurst, leberkase, spaetzle, red cabbage, sauerkraut, black forest cake, apple strudel, etc. My dad had the jaegerschnitzel which was plated on top of home fries. It was enormous! Very tasty and cooked perfectly. My sister had a bratwurst and knockwurst alongside potato salad and sauerkraut. Also tasty. I chose the steak tartare as I was feeling adventurous. It came served atop small bread pieces with potato salad. The quality of the meat was amazing! My grandmother had ordered this dish many times when she was alive and I have always wanted to try it. Glad I finally did! I would highly recommend this German restaurant if you are looking for a dark and classic place to dine with your family. Enjoy a pint of a good German beer and a giant plate of food! You won't regret it!"

The place - old school decor which builds a lot of character for the place. Multiple seating options and you feel comfortable due to the spacing. Service - plenty of workers at this establishment who was attentive and friendly. Our waitress (forgot her name) was there for what we needed and filled our glasses of water without asking (love that). Food - beef goulash - must get! Share it with friends or hog it yourself!! A very hearty soup that can be an app or an entree. Jagerschnitzel - my go to when I go to a German spot. The portions here are huge!! You can easily just order this for 2 people. I had mine for myself and took the rest for lunch the next day. Everything about it was great. Perfectly seasoned cutlet, crispy hash and savory mushrooms. just a delish meal.

She nearly ejected out of her car seat when I told her where we were dining as she had been wanting to go for years. When we walked in, she smiled a huge ecstatic smile at being somewhere she knew was authentically German. For her, It was like stepping back in time to a homey space when her mother was alive and times were good.

Since we had made the trek over and it was the last thing on my list of ""places to eat in NYC,"" we patiently waited for a table (our wait ended up being 70 minutes). The front entryway is a bit small so got cramped with all the people waiting for tables. They only take reservations for parties of three or more, and the restaurant is actually not that big so there aren't that many tables/seats. Several would-be diners were turned away by the hostess's rudeness; the prevailing theme seemed to be that the food here is good but the service mediocre. Notably, a table of four sat empty for over thirty minutes despite the throng of people waiting; we thought maybe it was being held for a reservation, but no one ended up being seated there, and the chairs actually were taken for use at another table later.When we were finally seated, we were quickly brought complimentary bread and my friend and I immediately placed our orders (we had had a lot of time to peruse the menu while waiting). Unfortunately, they ran out of duck (one of the Saturday specials), so we ended up ordering the jaegerschnitzel and prime rib, in addition to a cup of goulash. I really enjoyed the complimentary bread; it was warm and flakey, and a pretty decent size for two people (they give multiple loaves for larger parties). The goulash was flavorful, but definitely would have tasted better hotter (it was lukewarm). The entrees were good, and definitely were HUGE portions (the prime rib in particular was a ridiculous amount of meat, over 20 ounces for sure). Vegetables included but you might have to ask (the menu says ""available on request"").My friend doesn't eat that much meat, and she also doesn't love mushrooms (jaegerschnitzel is covered in mushroom sauce), so I don't think she really found this meal that enjoyable. I will say that I have had better German food for less money elsewhere (e.g. Anaheim, CA and especially Fredericksburg, VA). Nonetheless, our waitress was actually pretty friendly, and I thought the interior was cute/made you feel like you were in Bavaria.Our total bill after tip came to $90 (most entrees are $20+). Granted, the prime rib at $36 was a very generous amount of meat and we had leftovers of both entrees, so I guess overall value is debatable.I would recommend coming during a non-peak time; it will make your experience much more enjoyable!"

Opened since 1972 and still packed for dinner any night you go. I find myself here every other month or so to get my steak tartare fix, which I'm absolutely obsessed with. Still have yet to find a place that makes it better than them.Immediately when you walk through the door you will find a nice homey feel to the place. It's the kind of place where you can just plant yourself at the bar and never want to leave. Definitely a good thing because without a reservation you'll probably find yourself waiting there for a bit, especially on the weekends. Once seated you will find a menu of traditional German fare from brats to tounge and potato salad to schnitzel. It nice how they don't give in like some other German restaurants and throw American dishes on the menu. Hate it when that happens. I would like to recommend something but really everything is delicious. Definitely be sure to have a beer in one of their heavy mugs and always end your meal with a apple strudel alla mode."

Also not a beer fan but DAMN, the raspberry beer (don't remember what it was called but I posted the photo with its name and am too lazy to refer back to it).

The pork is huge and cooked perfectly and the portions are huge. We also shared the potato pancakes which were perfect.  Very crispy but not greasy or soggy at all and they're very big and come with apple sauce. For dessert i had the apple strudel and my friend had the black forest cake which i usually hate but it was actually pretty good.  I just wish the apple strudel was heated all the way through.

(Honestly, I really didn't want to wait if there was going to be one. This craving had to be fed ASAP lol) The classic German styled bar instantly attracted me. Rustic wood and dark decor made me feel comfortable and calm, ready to take on a heavy hearty meal. The bartender Tommy said hello and asked how I was doing before I could even finish settling in on the hightop rotating bar wood chair that my small feet dangled from. I knew this was going to be the exact experience I've been looking for.I skimmed through the menu with pretty much an idea of what I already wanted. I asked for a particular taste and style of German beer and Tommy picked the perfect one and skilled the perfect pour. KUDOS to that! I started with their Deutscher Salat which consisted of a fresh homemade cucumber, carrot, beet, and cabbage salad with a loose type of consistency dressing. I saved just enough to take home and enjoy again.Then, I ordered my main dish. Can we say it was UBERLY DELICIOUS! Huhnerjager was my choice. Two thinly pounded cutlets, lightly breaded and topped with their savory, yummy hunter mushroom sauce. It came with home fries, but home fries are a breakfast side for me, so I substituted it for the Spätzle.(egg noodle)I worked on exactly half of this dish and had to pack the rest to go for a rainy day. I was overly satisfied and full. It hit the spot in every way that I was looking forward to.Danke und Jubel!(Cheers & Thank you)"

However there were a few great German restaurants dating back over fifteen years, in the area that could hold their ground as well. Gebhardt's, Von Westerhagen, Neidersteins (now replaced by an Arby's--what a crime!)These restaurants were located in close proximity to Zum Stammtisch and were a viable alternative to the top dog of German food. But all have closed up shop which bothers me greatly because now we have no more than one option. When I walked into Zum Stammtisch last Tuesday in the early evening with my partner, who had never had German food prior, out greeting was less than welcoming. The petite blond, who left out the greeting portion of our entering the restaurant, immediately asked us both quite sternly ""Do you have a reservation??!"" Her demeanor was so intense I felt like walking out right then and there. Not the preferred method to treat your guests. To expound on this point just for a moment, I owned a restaurant-I always had customer service and customer management as a top priority, even when the meal was over and I thanked her upon my exit, there was no reply although she looked right at me, no acknowledgement of my thanks for dining at Zum Stammtisch.The herring in cream sauce was more lettuce covered in cream sauce with a few herring fragments and heave on the raw onion, hmmm.. A game of hide the herring to be sure.Sauerbraten was average at best, no onion, no carrot no gingersnaps, rather a  mass produced meat hidden below a  hot gelatinous swimming pool of sauce. The side dumpling was far from proper temperature for serving and there is not much that is more unappealing than cold potato balls..Pork loin Special was enjoyable, nice cut of meat and well prepared..Our server was amazing, she cared about our meals and served  our meals with genuine enthusiasm. Our young bus boy was so desiring to do the best job possible and succeeded in every aspect."

The tartar is  MUST try.  We also had the goulash soup, three wurst platter, and the jagerschnitzel. Aside from our embarrassment at how much we ate that day we left happy people.Hats off to you guys for bringing a piece of Germany to NY."

I've not had many experiences with traditional German restaurants but I know a good place when I see one!I made a reservation for a group of 20 to celebrate a friends birthday but unfortunately a few friends ended up not being able to make it. I felt really bad but the staff was extremely understanding and so nice about it. Most of us ordered from the Prix Fixe menu which is actually a really good deal considering you get a starter (either goulash soup or salad - I'd go with the soup, it was extremely good), an entrée, a dessert (rice pudding), and complimentary coffee or tea at the end of the meal for $21.95. I got the Jagerschnitzel (pork cutlet with mushroom sauce) which was absolutely amazing. We were all so full by the end of the meal that we couldn't move. But that's also because I got the Beer Flight (a sampler of four beers) to pair with the meal.Definitely a great experience and will definitely come back to visit again!"

I've never eaten at a German Restaurant before so I wasn't really knowing what to expect. Someone recommended the Jagerschnitzel and being that I love veal, that's what I went for. It was delicious. I don't think I've had better veal before. The beers I drank were also very good, and the mugs were huge lol. I live on Long Island, but I may have to take a trip out here sometime."

We were running late for our 5pm reservation on Sunday 12/30/18 and called at 4:35 to say so. The gentleman who picked up the phone said that it was ""no problem."" We arrived at 5:25 and the young, cold, uptight hostess said that we missed our reservation and had to be put on the wait list, which was considerable since there were many people waiting for tables. When we told her that we had called she said that the guy who took the call had already left and hadn't mentioned anything to her and that ""there was nothing"" she could do. No sympathy, no smile, no warmth, no trying at ALL to try to be understanding. I said, ""what's the point of calling??"" She just repeated, ""There's nothing I could do."" I see now why others here have written about poor service and a bad attitude. Some restaurants are just as busy but still love their customers like Manor Oktoberfest (Fantastic German food and GREAT service). Others like this one let it get to their head and think that they're doing you a favor. Never coming back."

We had a reservation so we were seated quickly. The waitress, she pretty much tried to rush us to order drink or food as soon as we sat to check the menu. Very rude! We asked for some time then she posed angry speaking with demanding tone ""No drink?""Remember You are serving ppl not feeding livestocks! We need time to see and decide!Usually we order food and drink to share with the group. When we ordered beer 2 liters I believe and tho it was like a pitcher, maybe it was my mistake of not asking if it was shareable but saying we have to share from one big boot shape cup (we asked for some glasses to share and she brought 5 saying ""we don't usually do this and gl serving?"") after that when we ordered food to share she said she had to charge extra per person for sharing and not ordering main entry per person (never in my life had to pay money for sharing!) At the end food came... Goulash soup tasted just like tomato sauce from pizza and way salty... And both Schnitzels... is it how these are made? I tho it was more crispy... but it was very soggy... difference btw the two schnitzels was just the mushroom topping... Experience overall ppl way overrate this place... For some reason random lady coming out of the restaurant said ""Good Luck"" to us..."

Great authentic experience. Decor and ambiance is just perfect and makes the visit so much more enjoyable. The staff is super friendly and does a great job making sure you've got everything you need. Fellow patrons are also so friendly and love to chat with each other. I guess it's because the restaurant gives off a home style vibe. Ordered the giant boot of beer. We tried the roast duck special which was an entire half of a duck served with mashed potatoes and cabbage. So yummy. Also the breaded chicken with mushroom sauce was amazing. So moist and flavorful. Potato pancakes are only served during the week which was slightly disappointing but the rest of the meal made me forget about them! I'll definitely be back to try more!

You open the door, and boom, Germany. Well, at least that is my image of Germany. The portions are huge so limit ordering too much appetizers but loved the steak tartare. I've never been here so I don't know if it is always that crowded but it sure got packed on a Wednesday night quick. I also don't know if this is because they were busy but the service was just ok.

Looks like it's quite the neighborhood establishment as well, and I bet that it's been here for many, many years. Lots of different beers to choose from, as well as a menu offering super hearty German fare, all while you're dining in something that looks like the main room of a skiing lodge in the Black Forest of Bavaria. There's not too many offerings for you if you happen to be a vegetarian (like myself), but I like the environment and the beer offerings here, which makes me rate this place 4 stars."

I mainly chose it because it could fit a large amount, take reservations, and on Tuesday night they had the a prix fixed menu option. Parking was a little tough, but we were able to find parking the next block over. The place makes you feel like you're in Germany which is very nice. The décor and ambiance of the place had the German feel to it and for me, since it was my first time dining at a German restaurant I had a pleasant experience (as well as my friends). Let me start off by saying it's a must to order their goulash soup. From reading other reviews I had to give it a try when I was there and boy was it spot on. Perfect. Delicious. Satisfying. As for the entrée portion of the pre-fixed menu I got the Pfeiffer schnitzel, which for me was pretty good. I'm not too much of a schnitzel guy, but my entrée was good. I guess I just didn't have the right taste buds for it. As for dessert it comes with a rice pudding which was very delicious. The service was great as our waitress checked up on my big party every so often to make sure we were doing okay. Water glasses always full as well. After the meal, in addition to the cake, we were all very full and satisfied. Well worth the money. Overall, my friends and I had a great experience and I would definitely come back again to try the other things on their menu."

All of them were really juicy and delicious, along with the sauerkraut and home fries they served it with . Also got their veal cutlet , which came topped with mushrooms and some kinda gravy sauce . Was really tender and crispy , and the cutlet was almost the size of my head huge :0 Two orders brought us to ~50 , and if it weren't for the fact that we were absolutely stuffed afterwards woulda ate more.

Incredibly tender meat and just a good stick-to-your-bones comforting kind of soup. A large bowl of this definitely could have been our entrees.Then I got the Jager Schnitzel with a side of mixed vegetables. Perfectly fried veal cutlets under the greatest sauce in the history of gravies. Seriously, I want it on every food that I'll ever eat ever again. Heavenly, creamy and perfectly complimented by the bed of mushrooms. Some hashbrown-type potatoes tucked under all this gravy goodness, which was a lovely little surprise. Something about this meal was just.. it felt like it was cooked with love. Like my mother was in the kitchen, taking her time and preparing it perfectly for me. To finish, we got the Apple Strudel which was warm and cinnamon-y and the apple still had a bite to them and flaky and oooof I can only imagine how much of a daydream it would have been with a scoop of icecream.All in all, the question is not if I'll go back, but exactly when I'll be returning.

Then there is a hallway that leads you to the restaurant. The place was decorated like an authentic Bavarian Inn with rustic wood & colored stained glass, moose head, very German from Decor to the staff.. warm & cozy OctoberfestI had Herring in Cream Sauce for appetizers, delicious & Prime Rib, Goulash Soup & vanilla Ice cream w hot raspberries. Last Friday the 5th, went back there again , did the same thing, shopped at their store, got some Homemade Goulash & Chicken Noodle Soup, Liverwurst, Chicken Schnitzel, pastries, Jellies, Crepes then had dinner.  This time I had the TBone Steak, rare , GoulashSoup, Creamed Spinach & the Vanilla Ice Creme w Hot Raspberries, delicious !!! Next time I have to try the Boiled Beef which was equally delicious & fork tender!!!"

Zum Stammtisch has mastered German cuisine. This is honestly the best German food I've ever had in the U.S. I advise that you come hungry because the large portions are like something out of Man vs. Food. My boyfriend and I conquered ""the boot"", which as you probably guessed is an over-sized boot filled with German beer.The servers were a bit strict. The four of us tried to move to a neighboring table. Nein! That table is ONLY for 6 people. The atmosphere is German in a somewhat Disney like way. However, I found it very cozy and ideal for the winter months, but then again Disney equates to cozy for most Floridians.The connected German grocery is incredible, I just wish they had later hours so I could keep my job and go more regularly. Unless you have a car its a journey to get here, but worth it in my opinion."

Better than average German fare. Large portions of schnitzel, wursts, and some great German beer. The wait staff could use a little better customer friendliness.

The Wienerschnitzel came with sauerkraut that melted in your mouth,,buttery and just the right relation of sweet and sour.The Sauerbraten was perfectly cooked with fabulous gravy, I have to go back soon it is so good.

Showing up at 6:00pm on Saturday evening without reservations is not a good idea on our part.  The waitress, immediately said that the wait was 1-1.5 hours long. They take reservations but only for parties of 3 or more. So being a party of two and limited time-killing options in the area, we decided to wait and chat. You can also wait in the bar, which many other customers opted to do with their 1 liter glasses and boot glasses. But we aren't big fans of beer ( I know, I know, why even German food?) After the accurately predicted estimate of 1.5 hours, we were finally seated for our meal in the absolutely PACKED restaurant. For my first German food experience, we selected the Goulash Soup ($5.95 cup), Jägerschnitzel ($26.95), and Prime Rib Steak ($34.95). We hoped to order one of the daily specials- Duck Roast, unfortunately they were out. The Goulash soup was quite delicious, filled with chunky meats and vegetables. My only qualm was the lukewarm temperature of the soup. In my opinion, soup should be steaming hot  when it's placed in front of you!The Jägerschnitzel and Prime Rib Steak were both ordinary dishes, no socks getting blown off here. Although the size of the steak was absolutely massive. I'd never seen such a huge chunk of meat on a plate in front of me before O_OOverall, with the average service and food, I give this place a solid 3 stars. During our 1.5 hour wait, I overheard customers absolutely raving about the delicious food. Per their reactions, I would be willing to try other items at this restaurant, but let's avoid a Saturday night rush again."

The food is okay but the service is awful. We barely had time to review the menu and we were asked twice if we are ready to order. At most restaurants they wait until you close your menu and lay it on the table before asking for your order but oh no, not here.On the opposite end of the coin, we were never asked if we wanted refills on our drinks, we were never given water or asked if we wanted more bread.When it came time to get the check our waitress was no where to be found. I had to ask another member of the staff to find her and get our check. When I finally got it, it took forever for them to pick up the bill with my credit card. The hubby had to search for the waitress. It also took an extremely long time to get my card back.I should have taken my own advice and not come back!!"

The food is consistently delicious and the portions are enormous. The atmosphere is old world German, authentic and comforting. I have made the mistake of eating at other German restaurants and ordering their version of the classic Jager Schnitzel, big mistake. Zum's is the gold standard, hands down. I am baffled by any negative reviews, seriously, we have never had a bad meal here in over 30 years. Be aware, it states very clearly on the menu, that even thought the portions are huge, there is a $5 sharing fee. This is not unusual for restaurants and it is clearly stated right on the menu, $5 is still a bargain for the amount of food are served. The clientele is loyal, many regulars, so that tells you something about how good it is. Parking is a nightmare, yet people willingly put up with it and drive great distances just to eat here.

I came here with friends and family. In general, it's pretty busy and full of people. The location is perfect with bus stops and trains close by. The inside is pretty and well decorated. There's a bar right where you walk in. They have a rule that you can't have more than 2 bottles of wine to prevent people from getting drunk and starting something. I had the breaded chicken cutlet (an outrageous $18 but worth it). It was fantastic! Just great! For desert, I had chocolate ice cream (no sprinkles, WHY?!) and it was HORRIBLE XP. It was engulfed with freezer burn. Just bad The service was awful. You can tell ALMOST every employee hates their job and wishes for their shift to end. The hostess was nasty and rude. Like we were wasting her precious time. Our waitress was kind and warm. Very pleasant. We had a second waitress because the first one left sick or something. This waitress was just annoying.

Yay Zum Stammtisch, for giving me a chance to hit 5 stars on a restaurant review ! The interior is decorated in a warm old-school German tavern style (lots of dark wood, deer (or Moose) heads on the walls, ceramic steins and mugs, etc. Making you feel like your cozily tucked in the cuddling arms of German grand parents. The service is prompt and polite. The tap has a number of German ales/beer to choose from (all delicious and served in rather German ceramic mugs or tall pilsner glasses ) The food is incredible. I started with a beef goulash soup that had bursting flavors for my taste buds.  I always buy my jaeger schnitzel which is always cooked perfect with a savory dark mushroom gravy on top. My companion selected the rib eye off the daily special list (which I have seen before here and was interested, but had never tried always opting for what I'm sure of) Well, with FULL confidence, I can tell you it was the best rib eye I have ever had at ANY restaurant (including 5 star Steak houses) I was SO soft and juicy, it melted in our mouths like butter.  We finished up with 3 deserts (though didn't have much room, but we were sharing amongst 3 couples) a Chocolate mousse, and apple strudel and something else which we had German coffees with (that had enough booze to kick you in the back of the head :-)  After drinks, meals, deserts and coffees the price came out to be about $130 a couple. Which although pricey for my normal night out, the fact that EVERYTHING was SO perfectly executed, I felt like I definitely got what I paid for. Although not often (because of the price), I will come back again (especially if they have that steak on the special menu)."

For $55.00pp they give you a 4 course dinner of pretty much the best German food you can find around these parts and was as follows:1. Goulash soup --- insanely delicious2. Smoked shrimp with horseradish sauce --- a little different but good3. Sauerbraten with potato dumplings and red cabbage --- best I've had since my last visit here.4. Hot apple strudel --- f@#% incredible like my oma'sTables were communal which added to the social atmospheric party vibe and we met some new friends which was awesome(Don't forget guys next year on the SECOND Monday!).Die Spitzbuam provided the evening's entertainment and turned this night's Oktoberfest into a wild audience participation free for all - including all of the staff!!

The half-size was HUGE - I couldn't even finish it (I wonder how big the regular size was). It was delicious!!! - the chicken was covered in a mushroom reduction and served with potatoes.

There are not too many places to go for good German food in Queens, so my boyfriend and I decided on this place. The Decor- super German. Feels like you are in someone's house as opposed to the restaurant. The food- Delicious! We ordered the Escargot and the Potato Pancakes (not on the menu, you need to ask for them!). They were delicious and very flavorful. For our meals, we ordered the Sauerbraten and the Weinerschnitzel. The schnitzel was absolutely delicious. Nice and moist and the home fries were perfect! The meat in the Sauerbraten was slightly over cooked. But all in all the dish was good. The Service- Was really fast, but was very curt. We unfortunately were seated in an area where there were a bunch of large groups and so I felt like we were a bit ignored. But I can ignore it because it seems to be fairly busy (for a weeknight) and they were probably running around alot."

Way to potentially scare away business there buddy!We sat down in a corner booth and I smashed my knee into something under the table... It was a barrel that was acting as a pedestal for the table.  I looked around and saw that all the tables are barrels with table tops and quipped to the hostess that was seating us that the tables should come with a warning because you can't see the barrel pedestal in the very dim light.The menu is not that daunting to get through.  They have the German name for most of the fare followed by the English explanation of what it contains.  I ordered the veal cordon bleu with a cup of split pea soup to start and the my girl ordered the sauerbraten.  While the saurbraten states that it comes with red cabbage and potato dumplings the veal cordon bleu just states the entree without sides, which turns out to be misleading as the veal comes with a side of home fries.The split pea soup was very flavorful and had bits of bratwurst in it to add more flavor.  The veal, I found, was overly oily from cooking but none-the-less delicious.  I tried sauerbraten... It was excellent as well as the red cabbage.  I wasn't thrilled at the potato dumplings.  I've tasted better and the consistency was a bit off.The sourdough bread that compliments the meal is amazing.  They also have Hofbrau Dark on tap that can be served in stein.  I saw that they have boots to drink out of as well but I didn't want to relive college and grad school that night.And for those keeping score... Yes, I did indeed bash my knee again on the barrel pedestal on my way out."

Even though it was about a $10 difference on a $142 bill its the point that they rip you off assuming your not going to really look at the bill (it's dark at the tables and we had 2 beers each) . When i told her I traveled from Long Island to come to the restaurant and said ""what happened to the customer is always right?"" she laughed and and said oh well and walked away. i took the difference in the bill and took it out of her tip! The 3 of us at the table where amazed at how stubborn the waitress (she's about 60) and the manager were.

Jagerschnitzel was also very tender for such a large piece of veal having absolutely no stringy bits nor was it pounded too thin. Breading was crispy, light and well seasoned.

The breading was well done, and the stock in the sauce actually had a pretty rich flavor. I should also note that the meal was large enough for three dinners.And that was after I ate an entire smoked trout.

I saw few recent bad reviews complaining about service, I am very sad to hear since I never got attitude from the staff.  They are respectful and quick, but they are not dotting (unless you had four steins of beer). They are diligent and hard working.  They don't sit around twiddling their thumbs. They always get you what you asked for and check on you no matter how packed the place gets.  Most of the staff are very seasoned have been there for years.   I understand that how swift and serious can get construed as abrasive or unfriendly but the service quality of an honest and efficient staff is one that I trust a lot more than an uptight, stuck up, fake smiling staff.   One tip, my favorite waitresses are Gina and Helga, they have always been nothing but wonderful and witty, so ask for them and you will great service.  Second tip MAKE RESERVATION especially if you want a table close to the weekend, they can be completely booked and walk in can have up to an hour and half of wait."

We walked in without a reservation at 5pm. We were told the wait would be an hour. I'm not sure why we are still here after just over two hours, but the husband really wanted to try this place, bc people who have actually eaten here enjoyed the food and atmosphere. Upon asking, how much longer... I was flatly ignored and told to sit down and I would be called when there was a table. NEVER EVER ATTEMPT THIS RESTAURANT WITHOUT A RESERVATION. What a disaster."

Knowing full well the place was gonna be more packed than a tiny car full of obese clowns, my friends somehow convinced me to go. Trying to be slick and beat the inevitable crowd, I called to make a reservation(The first time I ever made one in my life), only to be quickly shut down by being told they weren't taking reservations for that day. So then, my friends and I thought, ""The  place will be flooded by the time the game starts, we'll just go as earliest as possible"". We got there perhaps a good 3 hours before the game starts, and the place was so full,  I honestly couldn't fully expand my diaphragm comfortably without my stomach scraping against some stranger's sweaty back. But I accepted it and saw it as no fault on the restaurant  itself, in fact, that's usually a good sign. The restaurant, at least on that day, had a sports bar atmosphere, which is fine, but I was expecting a regular dining establishment, and again, no points taken off for that.My friends and I, being the optimistically naive lot we are, kept our heads heald high (Literally), hoping to wait it out for a group of patrons who didn't come to see the World Cup leave a table for us. We eventually resigned ourselves to our fate of standing until the game ended.Having been standing 3 hours before the game started all the way til overtime ended, (Why couldn't Argentina let Germany win sooner?), resting our legs took priority in our minds over obtaining sustenance. The feeling of fulfillment and release described so accurately and concisely in Harold and Kumar go to White Castle after one has endured an arduous trial and obtains what they so determinedly sought after will forever represent the exact opposite experience we shared. The food was underwhelming if a meal ever could claim to be. We all had different meals, and all of them disappointing. While I may not be a professional food critic, I have had a wide range dining experiences, and I know when a meal is worth its price, and this one wasn't.It might seem as though the cumulative bad circumstances altered my objectivity, but it is because I was so reliant on enjoying my meal that I put so much focus into my assessing my experience."

Given all the hype, the Black Forest (yelp.com/biz_photos/19o6…) cake was kind of bland and disappointing. Maybe it's just not for me. The warm apple strudel (yelp.com/biz_photos/19o6…)  was delicious, a bit crispy on the outside, but nice and soft on the inside. Service was so-so but it wasn't unbearable. The décor is cozy and old school, and I want to come back and try other things (and get the prime rib again), but it's kind of hard to get to without a car.

The portions are HUGE and the food is always fresh, very high quality. My husband never had German food before, he's born and raised in Puerto Rico but thankfully open to trying new cuisines. He loved Polish food so I figured German was next. Went with him and my parents they all loved it. Unfortunately he ordered a steak, it was a special he wanted well came out medium rare. Sent it back was still very pink. I tell him to stick with the regular menu items as he never has luck with specials but men don't listen  he ended up with half my jäger schnitzel and loved it, it's my favorite and definitely big enough to share. Dad had head cheese he was expecting a different texture but enjoyed it plus  3 different wurst platter and loved it, and mom who is a total meat and potato freak raved about her pork loin. We all tried it it was amazing, fork tender and had ridiculous flavor. Hubs also loved the goulash. I've been coming here for almost 20 years and have never been disappointed, my only advice would be come on a weekday and make a reservation as it gets packed on the weekends, I've waited over an hour on a Saturday with a reservation.

Knowing the beer, especially German beer is the feature beverage of choice at ZS but for the sometimes tee totaler, Lipton tea bags if offered should be free then.  At least have Earl Grey or camomile on hand to show you have moved past the 70s.  Maybe that's done on purpose for this institution to show it's still the neighborhood haunt for your meat and potatoes without any pretenses for making your meal healthier by adding organic teas.  Whatever the case, bring your appetite, leave your diet and enjoy!"

Gail had Sauerbraten and I had the Jagershnitzel  with sides of the best Red Cabbage on the planet and sauerkraut. Not to mention the decor is right out of Germany as you would expect . To make the evening even more special there was an elderly gentleman who was celebrating his birthday, and he got up and sang German songs and played his harmonica and it was such fun .

Served with a lemon wedge to add some great acidity to each bite.  The home fries that accompany the cutlet are how all home fries should be.  Tender with little pieces of crisp and bacon through out they are delicious. A fantastic dish.  The Sauerbraten was fork tender served with potato dumplings and red cabbage was also very good although I felt that it needed a pinch of salt.  I must add that the red cabbage went lovely with the Wienerschnitzel as well.  Yum!The food is well made and scrumptious.  While the portions are large you don't feel weighed down upon completing your meal.  A great choice for some authentic German fare."

This was one of my favorite spots in Queens in the oldern days, and I'm glad to see they're still grinding it out in Glendale.We caught a 3pm lunch, and the place was already lively. The crowd is pretty much middle aged people having kicking back and sipping German beers, and old timers who have probably been eating the Bratwurst for decades.We decided to go with the Jagerschnitzel, one of their specialties, which is a breaded veal cutlet with a sauce made from veal drippings and wine. We also got the Wiener Zwiebel Rostbraten, which is an steak served with crispy fried onions. Everything comes with a boatload of sides like potatoes, sauerkraut, etc.We liked the Jagerschnitzel quite a bit. It was cooked perfectly, the breading was crispy, and the seasoning was right on. But, for what it's worth, the sauce wasn't as good as I remembered. Very thin, and a bit flat in terms of flavor. I'm sure it wasn't, but it tasted mass manufactured.As for the Rostbraten, man this was disappointing. The steak was cooked fine, but it wasn't a particularly good cut. It was probably a 12-14 oz steak, very basic supermarket quality, with half being edible and the rest being fatty and sinewy. I also had to go to town on the salt and pepps because the chef didn't seem to do anything to the meat; no hint of a rub, marinade, seasoning, nothing. The fried onions were tasty at first bite, but were drenched in oil, and not crispy. I felt like I was eating breaded onion spaghetti or something.I couldn't help feeling that perhaps the quality had slid a bit in the years since my last visit. I used to love this place, but it seems to have transitioned from a really good and authentic German joint, to a nostalgia type place that you go to because it was cool back in the day."

It's a fantastic neighborhood restaurant that transports you to Germany from the moment you walk through the door. There was.a group of 9 of us we had an assortment of food including jaeger schnitzel, wiener schnitzel, sauerbraten, smoked pork loin, goulash soup, stuffed cabbage, and a melted cheese sandwich ( the only non meat option on the menu short of the sides). Everything was delicious and the portions humongous ( doggie bags for all). The red cabbage was devine as was the German potato salad, spatzle, even the mixed veggies were fresh and tasty.MUST GO if you want authentic German food and beer. Wait I forgot o mention the beer! The weizenbier was the best beer really smooth and light ( note you can't get a Bud light to Coors light here only German biers)"

Whenever you find an ethnic adventure, you always have to try it out. German food isn't my favorite cuisine, but this meal enhanced my love for this cuisine. The whole experience (except for the music playing) seemed really authentic. The decor was outstanding, as if you were in Germany. The staff were wearing authentic German attire. The menu, despite the price, is fantastic. The prices aren't cheap, but the food is amazing. The menu consists of soups, lots of appetizers, meats, chicken, authentic German dishes, sandwiches, and a huge beer list. Service was great, not the fastest, but definitely efficient. We didn't have appetizers, but I would recommend getting one if with a group. We did start with complimentary bread, which was delicious. We had a jägerschnitzel, which was delicious. The portion was large, the gravy was thick and tasty, and the veal itself was properly prepared. We had a chicken riesling, which was so juicy and tender. The chicken was perfectly cooked, and the wine, mushroom sauce was perfect. I had the duck special, which is only available on certain days. The duck was tremendous, filling up the whole plate. The duck was incredible, seasoned perfectly, treated well, a bit too much fat was kept on. The dressing was fantastic, very savory, contrasting the duck's almost sweet taste. Their sides are fantastic. Try the mashed potatoes, the red cabbage, the mixed vegetables, and their fresh sauerkraut. Make sure to come here for lunch, since it gets packed during dinner service."

We looked around and made a point to come back after lunch. We were lucky to be seated in the front (traditional) area, without reservations. It was 1:30pm but PACKED! - and it stayed that way when we left around 3pm. Staff:The owner was kind but always seemed aloof, always thinking about something else Our waitress was borderline rude, but she was very kind to everyone else. When we asked about the beer, she said ""I wouldn't know"". But looking around, all the other waitresses were smiling and nice. Bartender was very helpful. Atmosphere:VERY authentic German ambiance. Our table leg was a beer barrel! It made you feel as if you were in a nice restaurant and a beer hall at the same time.Food:Bread - Didn't look like much but boy was it good! Crispy on the outside, warm and doughy on the inside. No german butter though.Friday Special: Boiled Beef and Horseradish     The horseradish was very strong, good. The beef was tough. Flavor was good.Sauerbraten: Marinated Beef, Potato Dumplings, Red Cabbage     WOW! This was AWESOME! I wanted to eat the whole thing! The beef was cooked perfectly, tender and juicy - you could almost pull it apart with a fork. The red cabbage was great! Potato dumpling was ok... tasted like a potato matzoh ball. Jaegerschnizel: Breaded Veal Cutlet, Mushroom Sauce, Homefries     We had great expectations for the Food Networks ""Best Thing I Ever Ate"" dish but were highly disappointed. Of the 4 dishes we ordered, it was the one we liked the least, not to say it was not good - it was just nothing special. Like a glorified Country Fried Steak. And at $25? It was not worth it. It was the only dish we brought home (the rest were devoured). The portion was larger than all the other dishes. 1 Bratwurst, 1 Krainerwurst, German Potato Salad     Mmm! Both were delicious! I would definitely get this again! But for $15, kinda pricey. I can't wait to come back to Zum Stammtisch... it's just a but pricey - but worth it!"

You will have by far the best German meal outside of Munich here. I always start with the goulash soup because it is so tasty, hearty, & filled with tender, moist meat. It's seriously the best. Then, I always order the Jäger Schnitzel which is by far one of the best meals I've ever eaten in my life. The crispy, lightly breaded veal cutlet is extremely tasty & delicate & hearty. It's also a hugely generous portion! It is served with the most amazing home fries & sweet red cabbage. In the winter, I always get a mug of gluwhein, which is superb at Zums. Gluwhein is a warm, mulled red wine with brandy, orange, spices, & sugar that I absolutely love & it packs a nice punch on this Ukrainian/Austrian chic :) The service is always good. The food is always outstanding. Do yourself a favor & go!!!!!! You will not be disappointed!!! It is so incredibly delicious!!!"

I have been coming here for the past ten years and have never been disappointed. The atmosphere is very warm and inviting, like stepping into a Bavarian home with cozy nooks and booths. The waitressess are lovely and the food is amazing. The schnitzels are all great. I highly recommend the Jagerschnitzel. If sausage is your thing, try the Krainerwurst.  It is a hickory smoked pork sausage that is so flavorful served with sauerkraut and potato salad.  If you cant make up your mind which sausage to try, you may get all three;  bratwurst, knockwurst, and Krainerwurst. The creamed spinach is so good you can make a meal of it. But why stop there. Let me back up. To start with they serve warm pumpernickel bread (which happens to go well with any one of the thirst quenching beers. They have barrel beers, wheat beers, imported, domestic and non-alcoholic beer. If you are feeling extra thirsty, get the boot, but have a  friend drive!) The chicken Riesling is another favorite. If you are vegetarian,  the potato pancakes, smoked brook trout, the list goes on and on. Now to end a perfectly savory,  hearty meal you cannot leave without trying the streudel or rice pudding, at least share one if you are too full! You no doubt will be adding this to your favorite list of restaurants."

Another thing which can't go unmentioned (because it sure as heck didn't go unnoticed): the bathroom smelled absolutely horrible, and there was--I kid you not--a large amount of excrement on the floor, and when i told a restaurant employee about it there was literally a five minute delay before anything was attempted to be done about it... Anyway, the food --after the aforementioned incident I had to go into complete denial, pretending I saw nothing, distracting myself constantly to keep my mind off it--it's decent... When you sit down they bring you a very generous portion of very tasty--especially when piping hot--bread, though I wish the butter weren't served in packets. All the garnishes (parsley, lettuce, tomatoes, pickles) that came with the entrees were a bit limp and lifeless, but the food itself (homemade headcheese with onions, leberkaese with potato salad, cucumber/beer/carrot/cabbage salad, kassler rippchen and bratwurst with homefries and sauerkraut) was pretty good -- I don't know of anywhere in NYC to get better German food... I've been here before, awhile back (after my friend gave a piano recital at Queens College), and had the Sirloin Steak which I remember being pretty good... The beer collection is, fortunately, very affordable, but unfortunately not very extensive -- though they do have a favorite beer of mine, Schlenkerla Maerzen for $6 (for 500ml!)... There were four different people who had birthday cakes brought to them, and at least a dozen people were taking pictures throughout the evening... The crowd didn't seem very adventurous -- I heard two different people say how disgusting they thought Steak Tartare is, and pretty much everybody ordered the Riesling Chicken or the Sauerbraten... I'd recommend this place if you have a lot of time to waste on travel, and hopefully the bathroom will be clean... I'll most likely come back in the future, but not any time soon -- I'm going to explore more convenient alternatives."

After eating at a couple other German places, I am kicking myself for not trying it here- because I have learned that I really like it! My friends say that the sausages/schnitzel is amazing here. When I came to Zum Stammtisch, I had the Chicken Riesling, which was in a thick, delicious mushroom-y sauce that stood out so much from so many other things that I've eaten that I still remember it! They also have the 2L DAS BOOOOOT here, which I really wanted to try, but I don't think I could fit that much beer in one little body lol. Overall, it's a little pricey, but it's authentic homestyle cooking, so I think it's worth it. I'd love to go back!"

Modern, motivated, delicious and fun. We've found a new favorite Filipino restaurant among favorites to incite another 2 hour chat about our best meals. If you haven't been here yet, don't sit on it- just go! We shared the giante calamari, shrimp with salted egg and fried beef short rib over a caramelized sauce. The salted shrimp egg was short of religious enlightenment it was so so good. Perfect balanced flavors of young ginger, coconut milk, shallots, head juice of shrimps and of course- ode de la salted egg. We couldn't get enough of that yellow edible gold, seriously. That giant squid is a fanfare and great for crowds. Crunchy, messy, bang for your buck fried goodness- we want to try their bbq meat and kare kare fried pork belly next time but was not disappointed in any way with the squid. Alas, there was fried hunks of fatty short rib doused it unctuous, candy brown gravy. What's not to love? This one is more for the sweet n sour, General Tso's lovers in my opinion (you're welcome).

The lumpia was delicious and the meat tasted really fresh. We ordered the oxtail kare kare, which came with 2 big pieces and 4 smaller pieces. It was a big portion for two people. Make sure to order garlic fried rice to eat with the peanut butter gravy! We also ordered pork belly with garlic and black vinegar, which is another typical flipino dish. I would have probably rather order the sisig instead. The price was really good for the amount of food we had. We didn't finish our food of course and we made another meal out of it for $70.

What brought me here was an instagram post featuring the Calamari Gigantes. This is a massive giant fried squid that will draw the attention of all the tables around you. My boyfriend and I were pretty practical so we only ordered the squid and Adobo rice. The squid is certainly not appetizer sized, and we only managed to finish half of it. It was deliciously battered and fried, but the sight of the oil dripping onto the table made me slightly queasy. Even so, I happily enjoyed it with the Adobo fried rice. The rice was too bland for my liking, but the squid's strong flavor compensated for it. For dessert, we tried the Taho-- a tofu custard with tapioca pearls and caramel syrup. It was sweet and light: the perfect dessert to follow the heavy meal. Dessert lovers will rejoice upon seeing that they have all the popular Filipino desserts like Halo Halo, leche flan, and cassava cake.The affordable prices and extensive menu invite you to visit often."

Since I personally am not that experienced with Filipino cuisine, I had my Pinoy foodie friend do all of the ordering and be my guide. Since my friend isn't the biggest fan of squid, we skipped the Calamari Gigantes appetizer, but from the other tables that ordered it, it looked incredible and I need to go back and get it. As for the dishes we ordered, the chicken lumpia were fresh out of the fryer, juicy on the inside and you could tell that they were made in-house with a lot of care. My friend was DELIGHTED by the fish sisig. I have no experience with the traditional pork preparations to compare it to, but I was perfectly happy as well and thought it was a very unique and different way to prepare and serve fried fish. The bagnet express was delicious. Rich, creamy coconut curry with stewed chunks of fried pork belly that was somehow both still crispy and yet tender all at the same time. That over rice was just heaven. I wasn't too crazy about the lettuce garnish they served it with, however (which I was told is not a common accompaniment for such a dish). Since the curry is generally eaten with rice, the lettuce and the rice sort of clashed in a weird, uncomplimentary way. The palabok noodles were also terrific - but what's not to love about rice noodles, gravy, crispy pork skin and seafood all mixed together? If you're coming for dinner, MAKE A RESERVATION. This place gets packed."

Initially drawn in my the pictures of the interior decor, decided to try it out for lunch today. We ordered the milkfish ($14.95), tilapia ($14.95), trio dessert ($8.95) and pork ($11.95). Regarding the seafood dishes, I thought the value was pretty great considering you get a WHOLE fish!  The milkfish was grilled and I felt it went a bit too long on the grill as the meat was a bit dry. The tilapia was great and meat was juicy, the only burdensome thing was having to eat cautiously because of all the bones. Still for less than $15 with salad and rice, I think the pricing is good.The pork, compared to the portion sizing of the fish (which arrived to the table first), was small and honestly at least 1/3 was bone. The vinegar made its way through the meat well, but I thought it was a little bit too salty. In saying that, the meat was well cooked and still tender. This also came on a small bed of salad with a bowl of rice. I couldn't justify the price tag for this dish though.The trio dessert was nice, especially the ube on top! The flan was delicious too! The casava cake was plain and texturally incompatible with the other dessert components. I think instead of doing a layered dessert assembly, serve it deconstructed and it will allow patrons to appreciate each one better. The fake whipped cream used for decoration could well be replaced with freshly whipped cream too, this will enhance the overall flavours of the desserts. The $8.95 price tag is a bit too ambitious as well, so I thought.The staff were very attentive, loved how they made use of the space and decor concept. Naturally, being a Pinoy establishment, they had karaoke!!!! It would have been so great to hear some when we dined but perhaps that's for the evenings. The restaurant is child friendly, they have high chairs available too.Worth checking out if you're looking at broadening your culinary experiences :)"

How I would love to give Kusina Pinoy five stars. The food was just amazing. The Lumpiang Shanghai were crispy, just right, and the Oxtail Kare-Kare so soft all around you'd think it was file mignon. And its peanut sauce, hmmm, hmm hmm.The Siningan na Baka was plentiful, with enough beef and vegetables to tame the coldest of the night. Overall, from a gastronomic perspective, it was close to perfect. We thought the Calamansi juice was way too syrupy but that could be a cultural assessment. An outstanding meal at a great value.However, the service was complicated. We sat down at around 7:35 and ordered about 10-15 minutes later. We were a party of three, and save for four other tables, the ample locale was empty. Our main course came in at 8:35, and it preceded the Lumpiang appetizer. The waiter was somewhat apologetic but he didn't stay on top of our order. It's a shame since I was very close to walking out before our meal was served. And I would have missed out on quite the treat.Others have mentioned the karaoke and how annoying it can sound. Even good food has its limits, and it can't make people sing better."

People come here to share food and culture. Ethnic performances, instruments and dances are featured on weekends.The fishball appetizer is a blast from the past. Ampalaya (bitter gourd) had a distinctly watery sauce but good flavor. The Kare-Kare is one of the best we tried. Wonderfully thick peanuty sauce is perfect with the equally thick cuts of tender oxtails. The calamansi juice drink is made with honey, a perfect tonic for the cold or sore throat. For dessert, we tried Mango Turon. Deep fried bananas with a scoop of mango ice cream. Perfect ending. Service is cheerful and friendly. All the servers checked up on us frequently.

The food is delicious and the inside is maganda with an open kitchen. It can't get better then that!  So with the food me and my sibilings shared the Crispy Pata, Beef Short Rib Kaldereta, Calamare Gigantes, Lechon Kawali. We were definitely stuffed and satisfied, the only thing I wish they had was alcohol! We did order the Calamansi Juice and we loved it! Overall, this place is unique, authentic and creative.

The layout has stayed the same.  There's a full-sized bar and waiting area at the front, tables on either side of the restaurant and the open kitchen in the back.  They did update some of the décor which makes it feel more modern and classier. I really liked the wood paneling with the leather seats in the main area and the touches of red throughout the restaurant.  They have two screens that plays filipino songs and on weekends they have karaoke. We came on a Sunday for lunch and we noticed that there were already two big groups eating inside.  It's nice to see that they can accommodate big groups here. The restaurant is child friendly and has highchairs available but alas, no changing tables in the bathroom.I must say that the service was top notch.  The waiters and hostess were all very attentive and friendly.  We got our water refilled 3- or 4-times during lunch.  The manager came by towards the end of the meal to chat with us.  And a couple of the wait staff came by several times to check up on us during the meal. We ordered Lumpia Shanghai, Kusina Bistek, crispy pata, garlic fried rice, spicy Laing, halo-halo and Sago't Gulaman. I really like the plating and presentation of the dishes we ordered but did think that some of it was overprice. I found the sago drink to be a little bit too sweet.  I felt it could have used more ice to help dilute the flavor. The lumpia shanghai was very good and not too greasy.  It came with the usual sweet and sour dipping sauce from a bottle.  The bistek was my least favorite dish of the whole meal.  The meat, while tasty, was incredibly tough.  And the portion was so small, barely enough for one person. Strangely, it came with a huge side of white rice.  Still, I would not recommend this dish.  The crispy pata was also on the small side but quite good.  It had a nice crunchy skin and the meat was not too fatty.  It did not come with the usual pickled veggies but only with a small dipping of soy sauce.  Too bad because it really needed that acidity from the pickled veggies to cut through all the heavy meat flavor.  The spicy Laing was a real pretty dish to look at.  It sort of had the ""deconstructed"" look with the taro leaves on one side and the sauce on the other.  This is not the normal way it is served but I thought it was quite interesting.  The dish had a nice punch but was not too spicy.  I could tell from the taste that they used canned taro leaves which gives a strange after taste in your mouth.  My companions like this dish, me not so much.  The garlic fried rice was quite yummy, but I really wanted it to be more garlicky--just a personal preference.  The best part of the meal for me was the dessert, the halo-halo. This came in a tall glass and had very good flavor.  You could really taste the taro in it, and I loved the crunchy rice topping.  It was a bargain at $7.  I would come back just to order just this. I'm guessing they are still experimenting with the menu since they are a new restaurant.  I'll probably come back and give them another try but will wait for a bit."

I appreciated them making us feel welcomed and comfortable which is honestly kinda rare in NYC. The fish sisig is not listed on the menu, but we were able to have them serve it for us. Speaking of the fish sisig, it was TASTY and a bit on the saltier side, but it was literally cooked to perfection. Pair that with some rice, and it's the best thing ever. During dinner, we had the halo halo which is a classic filipino dessert. They add ube in theirs which definitely contributed to it being overall more on the sweeter side. I would recommend this place to anyone visiting the area. However, it can be a bit loud and hype for someone who prefers a quieter place to dine-in at since they have karaoke in the restaurant, but I mean, that just adds to the authenticity of a filipino restaurant. :~)"

No wait. Well lit with a modern flair, the decor here is much nicer compared to neighboring Filipino restaurants. They even have karaoke! Anyone can go up and sing although I am unsure if there are English song options. Honestly I did found the karaoke to be annoyingly loud. I was there to catch up with friends so naturally I want to be able to hear them talk but the singing and the speakers were SO LOUD. Luckily it was not continuous. We ordered to share: lumpiang Shanghai, pork sisig, crispy pata, large garlic fried rice, chicken adobo, and the halo halo dessert. I actually had Filipino food the day before at Tito Rad's so naturally I am going to compare...- Lumpiang Shanghai: I feel like you can never go wrong ordering this dish. Tasted like little fried egg rolls. I like that it doesn't contain shrimp which I am allergic to. Good, nothing special. - Pork sisig: My favorite dish of the night. I haven't eaten at many Filipino restaurants, probably just like three or so but this is the best sisig I've had. - Crispy Pata: A staple at Filipino restaurants. While pretty tasty, it falls short compared to the crispy pata at Tito Rad's. A little more expensive here, smaller, and just not as flavorful. - Garlic Fried Rice: Always a hit but I did find I prefer the garlic fried rice from Tito Rad's more as I think it's much more garlicky and fragrant. - Chicken adobo: This was very disappointing. Don't get me wrong, the chicken itself was good but it is not your typical chicken adobo. I was hoping for some gravy or delicious sauce to pour over the garlic fried rice but it didn't came with little to no sauce at all! - Halo halo: Another disappointment. Not sure what was all the way at the bottom of the cup but it was sickly sweet. Wasn't a fan. We didn't even finish it and it was shared between four people. That says a lot. Overall I thought this restaurant was just okay. I'm not sure if I would come back honestly. However the calamare gigantes and the baked mussels look pretty darn amazing. So we will see!"

The interior of Kusina was lovely. Plenty of space inside a long row inside that leads up to a open air kitchen setting which is really cool to see. The inside of this restaurant is a bit more modern to what you're use to seeing amongst the other pinoy restaurants in the area. They even have a full sized bar in the front area (liquor license to be approved by next week - will definitely be coming back for drinks) which is something you also don't see in Woodside. We tried 3 dishes. The Pork Sisig, the Lumpia Shanghai and the Pork Belly Kare Kare. Some classic staples in Filipino cuisine. The Lumpia was what you can expect at most restaurants, definitely a good appetizer portion but a little pricey at $9 for lumpia. The Pork Sisig presented on a sizzling hot plate (classic) was good, but need a hit of extra salt to bring out the flavor more but over all it was porky and has good chewy texture to each bite. Lastly, we tried the Pork Belly Kare Kare (most places will have just Oxtail, but they had a few other options here!). Kare Kare is a type of curry sauce that has a peanut taste to it. This was awesome and it was great to try Kare Kare on something rich but crispy like Pork Belly (you know it's legit when you and feel that crunch on the skin, oh yesss). Everything was great for 2 people. A nice touch at the end of the meal was a complementary dessert of avocado flavor icey (a popsicle you suck on from a plastic container) it was delicious and a nice subtle dessert to have after a dense and rich meal.Overall great place for a date to show them Filipino cuisine or bring a large group like your family! Can't wait to come back next time and try some drinks at the bar."

The portions are great for the price you pay. I had the spam breakfast, which was great and fulfilling!

We came on a Thursday night, it was not packed. The decor and space were nice; the other Filip places nearby are more dumpy/outdated so this is a place nice enough to bring a date.We got the giant calamari starter, the fried pork intestines starter, the mung bean stew, the stewed beef tamarind soup and the pork belly kare kare. The calamari was disappointing; the presentation was impressive but the dish was clearly for the 'Gram. It didn't taste of anything. It arrived dripping with hot oil but was not fragrant. The breading fell off in chunks as soon as we started cutting into it, so eventually we were just left with cooked squid on a stick. Neither the breading nor the squid itself had any flavor other than salty. The fried pork intestines starter was like fried pork skin, except thicker (and therefore harder). The vinaigrette that comes with it helped to cut the grease. The mung bean stew tasted like bacon, similar to how a split pea and ham soup tastes of smoked pork. It had slivers of bitter melon, which was an unwelcome jolt (we're not fans of bitter melon, and it didn't jibe with the flavor profile of the dish as a whole). The stewed beef tamarind soup uses fatty beef shanks, which made the soup base taste very buttery, but the sourness from the tamarind kept it from being too rich. My family thought it was too sour but I liked the tartness. The pork belly kare kare was covered in a sickly rich and slightly sweet peanut sauce that was way too rich. It came with blanched green beans, mustard greens and eggplant slices that went really well with the peanut sauce (better than with the fried pork belly), and came with a pungent and fishy dip similar in texture to XO sauce but with a strong fish sauce taste. It was a weird mix of flavors.The service was attentive and fast, but the food didn't live up to expectations set by the NYT review. The menu was different from other Filip restaurants in Queens, but some of the dishes just didn't work in terms of flavor combos. Things that were very fatty should have had acid to balance. Will not return."

Our group ordered a little bit of everything and just shared with the table. We came here on a Saturday night around 5pm. It wasn't crowded and they easily accommodated our group of 7. They let us sit at the table even before our entire group arrived. The food arrived in a timely fashion and we were not disappointed with any of the dishes. The restaurant got more crowded as the night went on but they didn't rush us out when we were done with our dinner, which we appreciated. It's always nice to just sit and chat without having the staff try to rush you out. Would definitely recommend Kusina & would come back !"

There were so many delicious options on their menu but certainly a lot of meat options so vegetarians/vegans, this may not be the place for you. We ordered two hot plate dishes because who can resist the delicious aroma of meat sizzling on a hot plate?? We ordered the pork sisig, sizzling chicken adobo and the bagnet express. My favorite was definitely the sisig, very flavorful and a great balance of meat and fat in every bite. The flavors of each dish were very unique and very rich. My friends and I finished every last bite of our food! For dessert, I couldn't skip the classic - halo halo. I had asked for ube ice cream but they only had a sort of ube puré. It was sooo good the ube flavor was strong throughout. I had to take off a star for the service, however. The restaurant wasn't very crowded but the wait staff was not very attentive. I had to ask for water twice throughout my meal. All in all, solid place."

I think that makes this restaurant a hit.. It gives the restaurant a Happy and positive vibe. They would make you feel at home. 5 stars is underrated. I would give them 100% as a rating.

Food was delicious and very authentic. The lumpia was probably one of the best I've had in a while. The drink menu was pretty solid. We had the sunshine Manila which was very good. Not to strong but the acidity from the pineapple juice balanced out the taste. The one thing I didn't like was the poor choice of music sometimes. Other than that food and place was astounding would definitely return!!

They close later compared to most filipino restaurants on roosevelt avenue, which is convenient for those that are late-dinner eaters. For appetizer, we had the calamares. It was served differently. Never seen gigantic squid on a stick before. Good for ""pulutan."" Then we got the crispy pork belly kare-kare, recommended by most customers and waiters. I can't comment and that because i'm biased to home-cooked kare-kare  nothing compares. Then we had the bulalo steak, which is another new thing to me. It was like a sizzling bulalo, not your common bulalo soup for the cold weather. It was good, i thought the gravy was tasty, and the meat was mostly fatty so that was the best part. We added binagoongang fried rice - shrimp paste fried rice, which was as expected, salty and savory. I wasn't a big fan of the ""sweet"" chicken bbq. I didn't like that the sauce was kind of sour. I'm used to the sweet bbq taste. Finally, we had their taho and ube turon. Taho was good but at a steep price ($8.95 for one serving). It was really good, soft tofu was still warm when it was served. I mean nothing compares to taho sold on the streets in the philippines but this was pretty good  The ube turon was interesting, another new thing. We usually just have plantain turon. The ube was super tasty. Lastly, the best part of the restaurant was their service. Their waiters/waitresses were quick, approachable and super funny! I hope they start a comedy bar, would definitely go back for that!"

The new restaurant on this Roosevelt  Ave. block is had a nice ambience and interior that appeals. It is ""industry design meets classic"" aura and one thing that sets its apart from other Pinoy restaurants. It does have the bistro/fine dining vibe.One would also take note of the overall service in this restaurant. It was a busy lunch hour then hence I would understand if staffs were busy but I commend that inspite of that, their ""wait service"" is focused and all goodvibe and polite. Keep up the goodvibe service!For the dishes served - I ordered Daing na Bangus, Kusina Bistek, had Kape Barako.  Plating was really appetizing when food came, it made me really want to dig in to the food. It was good. I particularly liked the  Bistek!  Anyone who would go here should try their Bistek! It reminded me of how my mom used to make one. I liked endless unlimited coffee - Kape Barako which is truly a taste if the real Philippine coffee brew! Anyone who likes coffee will like this brew, very original. I hope the Kusina management will capitalize in this signature coffee flavor of the Philippines!I was able to try one of their desserts - Crispy Halo-Halo. This is a twist to the traditional mix-mix dessert of the Philippines. One must try this! Again, the plating added excitement on how one perceived flavor and tastes. This was good.The wait time for the food was understandable standard 15minutes. Why? This is a gourmet style Filipino restaurant. They cook food as you order them, not a fast food style establishment! Once you see the food you ordered, you will say wow what a good food presentation. The house chef - is a master of style and creativity that commands good taste and appeals to most delicate epicureans.One item, last but not the least, I see overall the place is well-maintained, clean restaurant..from the main floor and their restroom. Keep it up. One customer will come back knowing the place is clean and organized.This is Kusina Pinoy Bistro, your level up Filipino food restaurant! Any non-Filipino nationals who are in for a good Pinoy food must try and eat at this place!"

I really liked the okoy,  calamare gigantes and tortang talong. All of which tasted familiar yet surprisingly new, also very nicely plated. Do try the dessert sampler to cap off your meal. Fine texture and not too sugary. I highly recommend this place"

Best part is that you'll feel home because everyone is vey nice and helpful.  Met the owner Dennis as well and I must say that I haven't been to a place for a while now that the owner actually cared for the customers. Definitely will be back here.  Calamari was good and more than enough for 5 people.  I either like the place or hate the place to have time to write a review here here.   Come check this place out.  We even got a discount first time visit 15% discount without asking for it.  I'm sure they did not have to but awesome gesture from them.

How is this possible, over priced for the area too, why go here when i can go to Rosario's or the several other options that are far more superior.

The pork belly kare-kare is good too, the pork is PERFECTLY cooked, I just wish they can put more peanut or peanut butter to the sauce. My daughter had the pork bbq, the moment it was put on the table I already smelled this sweet Filipino style bbq, I knew already that it's good! My daughter gave a thumbs up, boy it was that good! Lastly we tried the trio sampler, halayang ube on top, leche flan in the middle and cassave cake in the bottom! It was sooo good, they're not too sweet so I enjoyed all of them!"

Food was okay but not blown away. We had the Kare-Kare, Sinigang, and Tinola. It was definitely more than enough to share amongst 3 people. The dessert was also okay. Quirky twists to filipino desserts but not worth the prices. Avocado shake was literally mashed up avocados on the side of the glass,  shaved ice, and condensed milk. Service was great. Felt well taken care of. Servers are very friendly and attentive. Atmosphere was great and lively. TV is constantly playing filipino acoustic singers or someone is singing on the Karaoke."

It has a small entrance and the restaurant is narrow so you might miss it but it's there. this place has been another Filipino spot before but now it's totally different for the better. The staff is great the food is great almost everything is great. I ordered the Kare Kare and lechon kawali.  The good I got it tastes good with meat to vegetable proportion correctly.  Lechon kawali is cooked and flavored well. The service was amazing.  Always keeping your water glass full.  Very attentive. it can get court noisy in here because they do have Free karaoke. Also be careful on your way to the restroom as the small hallway towards the restroom could be slippery.  Otherwise overall great experience and would return there for my next Filipino meal.

At first I thought we walked into a private party the restaurant is throwing and also thought I hope they seat us anyway cuz they have seating way in the front.  When the music stopped, one of the waiters came and said sorry we were dancing and perform from time to time and we were like oh no don't apologize, it was great!  They were great! Such happy staff and I am so glad that we came here.  Now the FOOD, damn the food is delicious.  I used to go to Maharlika and it's gotten way too greasy.  We ordered the fried whole tilapia - yummy.  The palabok is so good, the bone marrow soup is definitely a must on visit from now on and of course pork sisig is not even a question.  Every single dish we ordered was delicious and very reasonable price,  The staff was very nice and attentive, very festive and happy here.  Oh yea there's karaoke too."

To die for. Only place I found in all of NYC that has this!  It's an ilongo dish very similar to spaniard style.  Omg. So good. Crispy pork Kare Kare. Their dishes are totally different from the turo-turo style.  Yes you may save a buck here and there at the other spots, this is priced but big portions you can share one dish 2-3 ppl. The food and ambiance are on point.  Lasang Pinoy for sure!!! So yes you have traditional meets modern.  Sisig is delish there are only 2 places I love it's this place and Sariling Atin.  Also, for a hot day they have different candy ice. I had melon and avocado. Still salivating over it. Coming back for sure. They are fast, humble, service is impeccable. Catering per head is good too."

But slow. We waited a long time to get our food. And for the place since it's  new and really clean.. But the food was not really as we expect it to be. Big disappointment. Small portions and overpriced. We've never tasted that kind of kare-kare( $17.99) It was very watery and kind of sour. I'm sorry, but it was bland, tasteless and why sour? And it kinda tasted like burnt. The chicken Inato was ok. $ 11.95 for 2 pieces of meat. We ordered dessert that never came. We sat and waited and waited some more till we just gave up and decided to cancel it. If you want a nice ambience for visitors, I would recommend this place but not for the food. Just being honest."

We had the fried tilapia in coconut milk, pork belly and pancit bihon. We also had the Lumpiang Shanghai and the chicharron polo. For dessert the trio dessert plate. We got seated right away, they had a high chair for my one year old, open mic karaoke and they kept our glasses of water filled all night. The waiters were super nice and attentive. The fish was yummy, just expect there to be bones. The pork belly was flavorful and they served a moderate amount of it, just enough to be full. The fish and pancit were both big enough to have plenty of leftovers. The Lumpiang was super crispy, nice amount of filling to wrapping ratio and it's definitely enough for at least three adults to share as an appetizer. The chicharron pollo was delicious, super crispy and served with a vinegar dip and lettuce that cuts the heaviness a little. Definitely a perfect portion for two. The pancit was great, the noodles were cooked perfectly and it was not overly oily. But hands down my favorite of the night was the dessert trio. Yummy, ube on top was sweet and creamy, flowed perfectly with the super soft flan in the middle and the dense cake at the bottom, served with light, fluffy and sweet whipped cream and two large strawberries. I would come back just to have that dessert again, perfection!"

I took my boyfriend here to try a more variety of Filipino food and we had ordered nilagang baka, tortang talong and sisig. The orders came relatively fast to our table knowing that we were the only people there seated so we thought that it would take a while. The nilaga was honestly pretty decent. It wasn't too bland not too salty, I just wish they had put some type of black pepper grinder/shaker on our take because I would've enjoyed it more with some pepper to balance it out more. There was a generous amount of beef and vegetables (some Filipino restaurants  I've gone to literally would give 4 cubes of beef). The tortang talong was my boyfriends favorite. It was very tender and the filling was so nice on the palate. There was no problem finishing that dish. Last but not least, the sisig... wow. I love sisig and this place delivered. Again, a generous size and the meat was very tender and the raw egg one top sealed the deal. I payed a pretty hefty bill for these 3 items but was pretty worth it. The employees were very friendly and made sure we were comfortable (despite the fact we were the only ones there). I actually forgot my card at this restaurant and called them to see if they had seen it. They found it and kept it safe for me for when my boyfriend picked it up (thank you again!) This place serves overall great Filipino food when you want to out and not at your Filipino mom and dad's kitchen."

We usually go to another restaurant just around the corner, but since it was already closed for the night, we decided to try this new restaurant out and we were not disappointed! The prices were reasonable for the amount of food we got. My Filipino blood loves a good pork BBQ on a stick, and their sauce for both the pork and chicken were phenomenal. However, as I was giving my mom a piece to try, she noticed that the pork looked under cooked. The staff was very accommodating and took care of it immediately, but honestly I think we were just very cautious and over reacted since it wasn't our go-to Filipino restaurant. I had already eaten most of the stick and I didn't even get sick the next day. The staff and manager were very nice and accommodating even though I made them go through a lot for no reason!! Definitely would go there again when we have impromptu dinner plans."

Kusina recently hosted our annual fundraiser for 50 guests and they did an amazing job! They provide a preset buffet menu with a wide variety to choose from and include coffee, tea, sodas and dessert. The food was excellent. All of our guests raved about the food especially the sisig, lumpia and veggie dishes. Everything was good. The chef also made a special dish for a guest based on their dietary restrictions. We were pleasantly surprised by this and our guest also commented that really enjoyed their dish. They also provided our guests with containers/bags to take the leftover food to go!  The restaurant also included table cloth (we chose the colors) and a center piece. Everything looked so nice! The staff was incredibly attentive and our guests also had positive reviews about the staff. Everyone was so nice. The water glasses were constantly refilled and the food was consistently replenished. They had everything set up for us upon arrival! As the organizers, we were a bit late due to traffic however when we arrived, everything was set up and there was nothing to worry about.  They also assisted us in placing our finishing touches. Karaoke is included which was a big bonus for entertainment. Booking is seamless and easy. We cannot wait for our 2020 event and look forward to booking with them again! Thank you for everything!"

With that being said i gotta add i lived in Charlotte NC and i go there on the regular basis at least twice a year to visit family and friends meaning that i know what good bbq is. If you don't know which are the main hubs and style for proper bbq in america, do your own due diligence please. So, my wife decided to find a spot for bbq and we came across with this one in Astoria and give it a try. We went for the basics, brisket , pulled pork, ribs, burnt ends.... Sides, slaw, cornbread. Brisket was decent, but not juicy as is supposed to be. Pulled pork could use more flavor and surprisingly the burnt ends (the super smoked and cooked ends of the brisket) we lacking that ""zing"" that they must have. It was like the if it was reheated. Portions were good for 3 at a tab of $60 worth of food. (1/2 pound of each). And plenty of cornbread too.Again, to be completely fair i'd give them another try once we are able to be release to the wild again if that would happen. But if you haven't had bbq any where else and you want to start this is a good entry point. Is city bbq and is understandable. I definitely will give them another try once we get released to the wild again, and try them at their location for the full experience if the powers that be allow it."

I went with my go-to at any BBQ place, a classic brisket sandwich and they couldn't get that right.I follow the rules ""phone eats first,"" and I should've known from the get that this was going to be meh. First bite in, it tasted like something you would eat at a Beefsteak Trick-Tray fundraiser. I couldn't finish the sandwich and I had to wash down my bite with their Berry Frosé - which is their savior of a one-star review.Sadly, I won't be back but since I left hungry I was able to find a solid restaurant nearby."

I advise you to look at the way this business responds to Yelp reviews. They do not respect any criticism and consider anything negative a rumor or fake news. Such an unprofessional business. Please listen to customers who are warning you that there are staff who don't wear masks and people do not always social distance here. It doesn't matter if the food is great. There are many restaurants in NYC who make delicious food and still respect their customers' health and safety or at least have the decency to reply professionally.

Full Rack Of Dry Rubbed Ribs; we opted for the dry rubbed not sauced we added our own Bbq sauce.

The Brisket was also served at room temperature...Sides; Brussels sprouts with bacon 2 orders, for me they were the star of the show along with the Candy burnt ends ....I did see a lot of tables eating huge burgers  stacked high .... and pulled pork sandwiches that looked delicious.....

I ordered a jalapeño margarita, it was very tasty - I liked it a lot and I'd totally recommend it.The food: I ordered the mopped & chopped brisket sandwich. My 3 stars are based on the food. This was not anywhere near the best bbq. My sandwich was moist and saucy but there was a lack of flavor- real bbq flavor. The tiny sides look cheap and terrible on the plate. The cole slaw - not good. The corn bread: reminded me of cafeteria cornbread. Price: the price was pretty expensive for what we had. It was $50 for two medium sized sandwiches and my margarita plus they give themselves 20% tip already built in (so maybe that's why staff lacks attention)All in all, I felt the staff was very kind to me personally but the food here needs to change for me to come back.

I ordered the Animal Burger which was also packed with flavor because of their sauce. I definitely recommend it. My husband ordered the St Louis-style ribs which he said were pretty okay & could have been meatier.

We then thought about getting something else--the waitress suggested the burnt ends because that's what they are known for. She said she could provide them as in an appetizer size. The burnt ends were worth it. I would say though out of both of our meals, I would come back for the fries and mac and cheese--not the meat.

The only thing I've had that I didn't love was the steak, but I'm not much of a steak person I guess. The PBLT is my favorite sandwich, and either the Mac and cheese or 5 bacon is my favorite burger, I can't pick one. The Mac and cheese by itself though from the starter options though is amazing, definitely order that. The side of Mac is ok but is not as good once you've had the full version. The salads are consistently good, but come out looking slightly different each time (like sometimes avocado is diced, sometimes is sliced ‍). I've uploaded lots of pictures"

It's a small room with the usual southern decorations filled w/ fairly new looking furniture. We were immediately greeted with a smile and seated with menus by the host, the room was 2/3 full with diners. Menus, water, condiments and utensils were placed right away. I found it awkward to be seated at the first two tables that were part of a row in the middle of the room. Later on, the room apparently got too hot so the front door was opened and had us feeling cold from the draft coming directly at the middle row tables by the door. The waitress said we can order anything on the menu except the alcoholic drinks to be included in our Groupon. We ordered :Garlic broccoli - tasted great! Not too heavy on the garlic, and broccoli done just right. Mac&cheese - on the creamier side, not cheesy at all, enjoyable except Mac could be softer.Chicken tacos - pulled chicken on the dry side, veggie / sauce topping made the whole bite good.Burnt beef ends - pretty good, less fibrous, really soft - maybe too soft texture almost mushy. Expected to be more burnt? 'Mama' chicken sandwich - only took a bite of the chicken tender piece since friend said it wasn't worth the whole bite. Good level of spice, tender, but nothing special.Beef brisket - little to none smoked flavor, so dry!Cole slaw - surprisingly delicious. Crunchy, fresh, not soaked like usual slaw.Cornbread - soft, not grainy, and sweet. Mediocre taste.Mexicane orange soda - mix between tang and regular orange soda w/less fizz.Lemonade - not to tangy, not too sweet. Just right and thirst quencher. Apple cake - not your usual apple pie. Warm, soft-almost doughy, not too sweet, tasty apple pieces. In the beginning all went well with a pleasant welcome and super friendly waitress. The room was getting packed and we started to notice patrons waiting with a face of impatience. Didn't take long for our food to come after ordering but I later realized there was only one waitress on the floor! 14-16 tables being served by 1 person?? Funnily enough, food inspectors had arrived for their inspection during this time. This pretty much jammed up everyone's service because that one waitress was chosen to guide the inspectors. A second girl had taken her place but service went downhill.The food wasn't all that. Price to portion ratio is within standards. Taste not so much. We  enjoyed the sides more than the entrées. Even if the inspector situation didn't happen, service was unsatisfactory. After inspectors left, both waitresses were on the floor but getting a lemonade took over half hour. Trying to waive them down for additional orders and finally asking for the check was a real challenge. Poor waitresses were stretched thin trying to tend to everyone in the room. I really want to give this place 4 stars, I really do. The Groupon deal is great for this place, I wouldn't come back here otherwise. Hit or miss."

One was really tender, but I didn't like the brisket thing that much. but both were good tho. Food was fairly authentic to real southern BBQ. We were just looking for a snack so we ordered brisket. I would go again if given the chance. Friendly and fun staff! The food is good too!"

We had the mac and cheese appetizer which was delicious!!! And we had the queso which was blah (so-so) . The drinks were superb I had the berry good time and my fiancé had the Texas cooler. I had a bacon burger which arrived to me without bacon after informing the Waitress she apologized and gave me the option of getting a whole new burger which would take 20 min or a side of bacon which will take 5 mins of course I chose the side of bacon but by the time it came out I was over it I could barely fit the bacon in the burger my bread started getting soggy. My fiancé had the 50/50 burger he said he liked it he also said that the beans and coleslaw were good. When we arrived the presented the waitress that we checked in through yelp and got a free side we each checked it so we each got a free side however on the bill only one came off, but to rectify the situation the waitress gave us two free moonshine shots valued at 7$ each so we didn't make a big deal for the 4.99 that the fries cost. I would go here again I would also recommend it to others"

We were greeted immediately and seated right away. The menu had lots of choices including meat platters, salads, and burgers/sandwiches. My friends and I decided to split the platter which came with choice of three meats (we did pulled pork, pulled chicken and beef brisket) and three sides (chose Mac & cheese, cheese fries and bacon Brussels sprouts). There was plenty of food on this platter for three people. I felt the meat was somewhat dry but my favorite by far was the Brussels sprouts with bacon - SO delicious! Our other friends ordered a platter which included the burnt ends which they said were really good and if I were to come back I'd want to try those. Our waitress was really nice and overall we had a great time"

For starters, the beer I ordered was no longer being served (but was one of the 10 being advertised), the food took almost an hour to come out (the place was probably 1/4 filled. Not busy at all), AND when the food finally did come the order was wrong. So needless to say I was not too happy with the first impression. -Smoke House BBQ Burger: 3/5, it was alright. The burger itself was like any other burger with bbq sauce on it. I've gotten burgers before with pulled brisket or pork on top so I was excited thinking this was the same, it was not. Instead it was two slices of very mediocre brisket slapped on top of the burger. This was my mistake as I thought it would be pulled not sliced. -Beef Brisket: 2/5, honestly shocked at how underwhelming the brisket was here. Very dry, with not much flavor. -Mac & Cheese: 4/5, thankfully this was great and saved the meal. For $6 I had high hopes which were met by this side. Great flavor. Overall, had I gone into this place not knowing about all the hype and hearing everyone rave about it I would've thought it was just another BBQ joint. After eating here though I personally feel that I would not return. The food and the experience were both subpar and I've definitely had much better BBQ food at other spots. Still glad I gave this place a shot though."

So the day finally came- boyfriend and I stopped in for brunch... and it was so good! We both got the brunch burger. Definitely a good choice. The burger was juicy and amazing. The home fries it came with were some of the most flavorful home fries I've ever had. And the salad was also nice as well. We loved their sauces and would mix it with the habanero and try it with everything on our plate.The brunch also comes with a drink! I ordered a Bellini and my boyfriend ordered a mimosa. Both were delicious. They have a brunch happy hour (I unfortunately forgot the times) but it's $6 each for the brunch drinks, after the one that comes with brunch. We enjoyed our meal and I definitely want to come back to try dinner!"

We got gimme the beef platter with burnt ends and brisket with 1 side of Mac and cheese. Mac and cheese was amazing! Burnt ends could have been less fat and more lean. Brisket was a little dry. Over all a filling meal and I would get it again. 5/5 service.

I wanted to order something different and introduce my friend to burnt ends. Luckily for me  butcher bar did not disappoint. They were delicious and fall apart in your mouth good. Although the only option was delivery the food still came out fresh and hot. They even included the complimentary apple slice which was nice. Thank you for giving me the same experience I receive in restaurant at home. We will be ordering again soon.

Then we order the brisket the seasoning was good but dry that was a turn down for us but since we complained they gave us a half of order it was a bit better. I order for my daughter fries & chicken fingers the chicken was so salted that she didn't wanted to eat it! Also order the Mac & cheese with cheese quesadilla very disappointed even the presentation was bad! The adults order were good can't complain! The service was really good the space is nice and open it is busy on weekends! But we didn't wait long for a table!

Was missed quite a bit. I came with my partner here for lunch on a Saturday and it was pretty busy. They first sat us down in the corner and seeing as we were forgotten for the first 15-20 minutes trying to order we asked to move tables hoping to be seen more. (Someone took that corner seat after and also had trouble getting someone to take their order) We ordered forth lb. of brisket, a pulled pork sandwich & fries all like warm. Both of our meat dishes were a little dry, maybe an overcooked batch? Not that bad though, wont complain since it my first time here. I guess the best thing were the fries. Seasoned and lightly fried.  Decently priced.P.s. Also took 10 minutes to get my check and another 10 to find someone to take it..... and another 15 to get my change. Had to ask someone to re-check on that.Again, it was a bit busy so keep that in mind!"

We visited after the dinner rush in a weeknight, and I noticed that our waitress had a friend come into the restaurant, which normally would not be anything to write about. However, after our waitress ""took"" our order (i.e. tried to memorise it), she then proceeded to have a lengthy conversation with her friend as she was putting our order into the register. So of course, our order came out wrong! She messed up our drink order, forgot to add the extra honey butter for our cornbread, completely forgot an entire entree, and put in the wrong order for ribs. She was completely unapologetic about it, and even had a bad attitude when we pointed out what was missing.Oh, and these ribs... apparently the ""Fall of the Bone"" St. Louis-style ribs are nothing more than the dry-rub ribs with BBQ sauce poured on top. Anyone with an inkling of barbecue knowledge knows that St. Louis-style ribs are supposed to be finished on the grill with sauce, and not just have the sauce simply poured on the top afterwards. And they certainly were not falling off the bone at all!Horrible waitress and bad bbq ribs. At least the mac & cheese and garlic broccoli were decent - hence 2 stars..."

Please read the fine print.. the coupon excludes steak and ribs!!!! Kind of odd since bbq restaurants specialties should include ribs. I tried the burnt ends and briskets and both tasted like it was oven baked. I was especially disappointed with the brisket which was so dry and bland. The burnt ends were flavorless and limp. The burgers were ok. The chili and fries were too salty, however the mashed potatoes and corn bread were really good. Our server was great.Wow!! Read the response from the restaurant, folks. Am I ranting and raving? Do this sound like a restaurant I'm willing to return to? Kathy, learn from other's reviewer's constructive criticism. We're not haters or ranting/raving 3 yr olds or have personal vendetta."

First, all of the food got here cold. When you pay for $40 worth of food you would hope they would be considerate to actually send warm food. The wings were tough to eat. You had to pull on it and basically what they sent was old/stale wings that were sitting there then threw some sauce on it and then put it to be delivered. The burnt ends had good smoke on it but were over cooked and fell apart. The bark parts were hard to where you could have broken a tooth. Lastly, the mac and cheese had no taste and tasted as if  no effort was put in to make it. Tasted like they took the macaroni out the box and boiled it and threw it in to be delivered. Plus it was macaroni with no cheese, NO FLAVOR OR TASTE, and a dash of paprika. Do yourself a favor, save yourself some money and just go elsewhere. One of the worst meals I have had."

The employees here look so happy and are the nicest workers I've ever encountered! The music was great, loud enough to jam low enough to listen to my boyfriend. The beef platter was amazing loved how they didn't put sauce on it and I was able to do that myself. I'm absolutely obsessed with their brussel sprouts it was sooo delicious I must learn the recipe!!! I however am giving it a 4 star because while the steak was soft and easy to cut into it had no seasoning and lacked flavor. For 30 dollars I would expect it to be super flavorful and juicy. The key lime pie was just pudding with graham crackers on it too. I will still be coming back however because those burnt beef ends were fire !"

When we got our plates we were amazed with how much food there was! I got the brisket and it was so soft, I didn't even need the knife to cut it! This is definitely felt an authentic bbq spot!

I ordered their candied meat which tasted really good but the portions were quite small for the price of 10 dollars. I also bought their animal burger which didn't really taste that good, mind you I was very hungry so my standards for taste should be pretty low. One of the major reasons that i'm giving this rating is because we waited for almost fifty minutes for our food to arrive. The place was busy, but I was starving when I got there. So don't go there if you're starving, you'll end up being grumpier 'cause of the wait time."

How about the person who waited to get seated and wasn't even acknowledged! Come on Kathy k , u cant take constructed criticism gracefully!Hi Kathy, My name is Nancy and I bumped into my friend Louis that wrote the above post. We started talking about the reviews and after reading them I am taken back by your behavior. I am in the hospitality business and shocked at they way you talk to people that post complaints. Your comments are outrageous! I think you would be a smart business owner if you started treating your customers with respect. Instead of always backing up your staff maybe you should take the complaints more seriously to improve their work habits. If someone has a boss that constantly takes their side no matter what customers had to say I am sure they get lax with customer service. You need to start presenting yourself as a leader and business owner and not a LOSER as you call your customers. With that attitude I can see your business failing in a couple of years."

YES PLEASE!!! I actually learned about this place through Groupon. It sounded good so I figured it was worth a shot. Yelp reviews supported quality food so I was eager to try. My husband and I went yesterday. I wish I could say I had pictures, but I don't cuz I was too busy eating. We shared the Diablo sandwich with fries, cornbread, burnt ends, 1/4 rack ribs, and Mac n cheese. Meat can seem a bit pricey, but we both agreed we'd prefer higher price, small portion + high quality, vs. cheap + huge portion ""meh"" meat. It tasted amazing!!!!! In all honesty not sure I would order the sandwich again, cuz I found I liked just getting to the point, the star, the meat!! But it was good. I was obsessed with the burnt ends which taste great dry, but even better topped with their sauces provided at each table. The ribs were truly fall of the bone! We're going back!! Next time will probably do 1/2lb orders. We were clueless with how much 1/4lb would be and now we know. Mind you we had a good amount of food and were FULL. I just need to leave with leftovers next time I had their hard pink lemonade which was amazing. My husband had a whiskey cocktail. It was a great brunch date! With twin babies it can be hard to get out. Glad it was a worthwhile visit while the little ones spent time with grandma."

Came luke warm. Biggest slap in the face is how small the $13 half baked Mac and cheese was. I was so offended I got a ruler and it was 4.5 inches by 2.5 inches big. You should be ashamed of yourselves honestly - I would have been a continued customer as food (once reheated) was fine and I can even tolerate a lengthy delivery time.

Something else to note, was that the meats were missing that smokiness that you get from other BBQ joints.Both dishes were served with coleslaw (a bit too wet and mushy), pickles, cornbread (kind of dense and bready) and choice of side.  The sides were great, the mac & cheese was creamy and wonderful; the Brussels Sprouts with bacon were very tasty.The apple cake offered to us at the end of the meal was actually fantastic; light and delicious. Overall, I'd rather get my BBQ elsewhere, but I will say the burnt ends and mac & cheese and the apple cake are things I'd visit for again."

Their lack of consideration and character is appalling. I made the right decision by posting here - this business does not align with my values at all. I'm devastated by the personal attack I just received from the manager, Christos. I left my credit card after paying a $200 bill, and ran to the restaurant as soon as I had realized it. Christos has recently left, and after getting him on the phone, he yelled at me and refused to help a customer in need get her card back. I'm disappointed in the lack of compassion for what was an honest mistake. He accused me of drinking tonight - but maybe when he checks my bill from tonight, he'll see that my party ordered 3 drinks for 6 people. EDIT: either the owner or manager responded on Facebook asking what ""any other restaurant in America"" would do. Well, I used to work in tech retail and we had very similar situations. More than once, we stayed open late, let a customer in early, and yes - even reopen the store in order to solve situations like these, especially when there were extenuating circumstances. As humans in any situation, we ALWAYS have a choice whether we want to go out of our way to help someone. Every single time any of us opens our mouth, we have a chance to show compassion and offer creative solutions (even to problems that aren't our own). ESPECIALLY at the management level, I urge this restaurant to do better in this regard. I am so disappointed and will refuse to patronize this restaurant in the future."

Our servers name was Christina she was helpful when my dad asked a billion questions. She was energetic, informative,patient and did all that with a smile. They don't wear name tags she has light eyes and a smile that could light up a room! She recommended the ""bourbon banana bread"" which was really good.

Not only were we satisfied with the food and service but it really made us smile the fact that the young lady that took our order over the phone was so pleasant. She was so helpful and went the extra mile. I always say it's the smallest things that count. In this time of need it's good to know that there is still some humanity and kindness left in people. Emily sent us a nice message on one of the brown bags which we just thought was just so nice of her and it assured that they care about the customer. That message really made our night.

No wait for a seat at the bar, decently priced cocktails (although light pours, at least from our bartender), overpriced beers, and the food was good with little wait. Docking one star for our bartender, Chris, for his lack of attentiveness. Didn't see a name tag, but overheard his name from his friends/co-workers he constantly chatted with. My wife and I ordered 2 drinks, and took him a while to make those. Not a big deal at first, but the repeated delay in his service became annoying considering a rather empty dining room. Even took a long time for him to take my credit card as he continued chatting with co-workers, and literally flirting with/tapping a waitress' ass. We noted this on their comment card, but now thinking about it, not sure if he would've actually submitted something with a poor review of his service to his manager. Another star docked for the food. It was good, but portions were smaller than expected and came out room temp.Trying this BBQ place for the first time made me miss The Strand on Broadway (how it used to be)."

It's a beautiful place and the decor is super comfy. We were here for brunch so maybe thats why I'm not giving it 4/5 stars.. I was honestly a bit disappointed with my order and even the candied bacon. The bacon wasn't cooked well. It was fatty and not overly cooked and it was room temp, therefore it wasn't crispy. It just felt and tasted as if it wasn't fresh. Main dish was the brisket hash platter and it looked great. But tasted a bit bland. Also it wasn't crispy at all. Potatoes were boiled and stirred with some sort of seasoning. When I order hash I kind of expect for it to be somewhat crispy or have crispy bites. Also was excited for the sausage hash but honestly I didn't taste anything. I'm hoping to be back to try the dinner menu. Maybe I'll get lucky then."

ARRIVAL - hostess took a while to engage and found a table for the 3 of us. Interesting to note the place was very empty but in 40 minutes there was a long line. AMBIANCE - what u would envision from a BBQ joint. Southern looking and kind of small in terms of the number of tables. SERVICE - waiter was super polite but not very engaging. Getting food took way too long given how empty it was. Albeit a number of folks streamed in. FOOD - the ribs were cooked well but the sauces we ok at best. I'm not a dry rub type so it was disappointing that the sauces were not spectacular. The side dishes were mixed. The Brussel sprouts and spinach were excellent. The corn bread was blah. The turkey sandwich was passable but not great. PRICE - actually not bad for ok cuisine three people with tax and tip was like $105.

It must have just been a blip/small piece because no one else mentioned any issues. The brisket was also a tad bland but they had a lovely bbq sauce to go with it. The entire platter was enough to be shared among 3 people so great value. Delivery was pretty speedy for a holiday (4th of July!) but I don't think I'd order again.

It was like 6 small cubes of meat candy and it was awfully salty. My cousins ordered burgers though and apparently it wasn't bad but overall, I wasn't too pleased. What caught me off guard though was that there was this skinny waitress who kept harassing us to write positive yelp reviews about her and the restaurant. It started from when we literally sat down to us getting up to go leave. I GUESS it would've been alright if the service and food was okay, but it's still super tacky nonetheless. I don't want to blast her on here but I definitely recommend the restaurant to fix that and maybe work on how slow the service is!"

We currently have a real estate reality personality with questionable views on everything. So....Why not vote for the most hospitable and charming bartender from Butcher Bar?Ok ok... it may be the Apple pie moonshine talking but Chris at least needs a raise if he can't be the next Pres. lolLast night was the perfect example of what the Yelp  Community represents. A group of elites at an event, get together to head home and remember a previous event at Butcher Bar. So they decide to stop in and introduce me to a totally new establishment and possibly my new favorite bartender. (And the start of a FUN night. Lol)If you didn't already catch the clue Chris was great. He was super excited that the other ladies were returning customers and that I was a newbie. He personally took care of us without hesitation. Monday's are 2 for 1 apps and he explained everything and even honored our check-in offers (a free side of your choice). He mixed up some good  drinks with his own special twist and hooked us up with some apple pie moonshine.  Chris made sure all of ours orders were accurate and each of our bills were on point. I order the Butcher Bowl w/ chicken (his recommendation), buffalo wings and a side of cornbread w/ honey butter. All of our orders were to go since we had just ate. However when I dug into my food I was a very happy camper.With that said... awesome drinks, great food, and excellent service. It was a wonderful night. So maybe Chris for Mayor instead then?"

Brilliant!  Two favorite foods (bbq and breakfast) on one plate?  Yes please!  Second - it's got a cool vibe.  Very casual with simple wood tables with red chairs, white subway tile, and chili pepper lights hanging from the ceiling.  And who doesn't love a neon sign spelling out BBQ.The portions are kindof amazing too.  For brunch most items are served with a drink (Bloody Mary, Mimosa, Bellini, Draft Beer, Coffee, HotTea, Juice, IcedTea or Soda) AND all dishes come with home fries, a salad and toast.  It's not fries or a salad - its BOTH.  For $16 I got a really generous quesadilla stuffed with pork, potatoes, salad, toast and (refillable) sweet tea.What's not so amazing?  That brunch quesadilla was stuffed with pork - but it was very plain.  I didn't get any sense of seasoning or sauce.  And the combination of monterey jack and parm was ok... but boring in many ways.  This could have been an amazing opportunity for bursts of flavors and there just wasn't any.  I was also missing the eggs in this brunch offering.  Maybe its just me but I think a breakfast quesadilla needs some eggs.  and not to nitpick - but my salad was over dressed.  Halfway through the meal I found the leaves to be soggy and I didn't end up finishing. So lesson learned with the pork quesadilla.  Tried it, liked it, but will probably order something different next time I'm at Butcher Bar."

Honestly, everything I have tried on the food menu (roughly 85%) is good. We never had to wait to get a table, which is probably disappointing the owners but personally I'm not a fan of waiting 20 mins for one. The serving sizes makes sure that you don't walk out hungry and the service has always been warm and friendly.     All the bbq meats are solid. But our favorites are the burnt ends aka meat candy, briskets and the ribs. The burgers are all quite good too. I would come to the conclusion that beef is the way to go here! The meats have mostly been well seasoned, smoky, tender and moist. Except that one time when I came in for brunch and the burnt ends were a tad on the dry side.Brunch here is great. The price tag is a bit higher compared to other brunch menus in the area but they do give you tons of food. Also, you can chose your beverage to be coffee, juice, cocktail or draft beer. Not too shabby I say. It is worth mentioning that the cole slaw here happens to be done to my selfish liking. Light and not too sweet nor sour, they go easy on the mayo, making the salad refreshing and just right. The corn bread here is nothing to rave about but the kitchen puts some whole corn kernels into it, so I will give it a wink-wink.Have I had better bbq somewhere else? Yes. But Butcher Bar is still great because it is a well rounded joint, no lines, great service, pleasant atmosphere and overall good solid food. There is no let down."

Our waiter was incredibly friendly and warming! 3 stars for food ...I was spoiled by Texas bbq and had an expectation with the burnt ends which is know as their best seller. Little did I expect the burnt ends to be dry and lack flavor. The brioche bun that came with it was lightly toasted. Cole slaw and pickles were great sides. The corn bread was a nice treat. My boyfriend had the 50/50 which we thought it was dry as well. So for both sandwiches we used their bbq sauce which we thought was delicious. Lastly, we finished with their apple cake in which most yelpers agree with that it was good."

Sat outside but the wooden walls and oddball decor hit me like an acid flashback. We remember the feeling of disappointment we had leaving the place over a year ago but we thought ""Hey, maybe they had an off day."" I'm sure you can figure out by the one star rating that we were wrong. We had fries, brisket, and half a rack of ribs. In other words, the good, the bad, and the ugly.The brisket was dry and had very little favor but edible in a state of starvation -- which luckily I was. But where Butcher Bar really left us feeling used and abused was the half of rack. Three of the five pieces were ends!! Not the delicious fatty burnt ends that were out of stock that night, but the dry barely editable shorter ends of a rack.When you cook a rack of ribs, you cook it whole with two ends. The ends are shorter and thus, drier because they cook faster. Why this Cooking 101 lesson? There is a point, I promise. How many end pieces should you get when you order a half of rack? One! And the rest? Bigger and juicier pieces all leading up to that middle melt in your mouth piece that is so coveted. We were ripped away from that delight and $27. When we try to ask the waiter politely (we were both in the service business) if this suppose to come like this, no one working was to be found for 10 mins. And when he finally did show up, he simply states, ""It is just luck of the draw."" My partner, who was a chef in a past life, was livid. Consistency is very important in kitchens and this answer told us everything about what type of establishment and culture we were dining in. Go to John Browns. Those fine fellas know BBQ.---In response to Kathy, the owner's comments:Mighty Quinn's, Fette Sau, even Dinosaur Bar-B-Que -- take your pick. They are all better choices than the three dry, hard pieces I was served at Butcher Bar yesterday night. Insidiously implying that your customers have an affiliation doesn't help make your case on your restaurant's ability to resolve complaints."

The sweet tea tasted like sweet tea...the end.And for dessert the banana pudding was out so it had to be good; but the lady called me to switch to either bread pudding or the apple cake. I asked what the bread pudding tasted like because I didn't know and she said I'll put both in there and you can try it out. (She didn't have to do that, but she's the real MVP for that because it was delicious... the apple was too.)Win-Win!"

This was good for 2 people to share!The fall off the bone ribs was very good! Literally falls of the bones, super tender and the BBQ sauce was very good. There was a lot more ribs than I've seen in photos since it's double stacked. The burnt ends were also very tender and juicy. The Mac and cheese was very good. It also came with corn bread, which was a bit different - more moist and less.We wanted to try their complimentary apple cake since it seems pretty popular here but sadly, they it's only complimentary for dinner.... but we saw a very nice waitress who offered to her tables as a complimentary dessert, so that was a bit of a bummer for us.

This place was like a JOKE!! Like the other customers already mentioned in their reviews, they gave me axactly the same disrespectful attitude for using a Groupon voucher! First, we did yelp check in for only 1 side order because the waitress said it is 1 per table! then, we said okay and accepted it. Then,at the end when I wanted to use my Groupon voucher, their Extremely Rude, Fully Attituded Manager told us that he is going to charge us for Yelp Check in Too!Btw, when you try to do yelp check in it doesnt give you any rules or terms to get this free side order! So, I have said okay.. Im going to pay for it.. Then, when we got the bill, he gave us only $36 off instead of $40!! And on top of that he taxed me twice!!! And he wanted me tax me even on third!! This guy with a thick spanish accent is extremely RUDE, and a thief because you cannot steal other people's money for only to fill your server's pockets without the permissions of the customer!!! I AM THE PERSON WHO DECIDES TO GIVE HOW MUCH TIP I WILL LEAVE TIP FOR THE SERVICE!!!And when I told him that you guys calculated and billed us incorrectly, he told me HE doesnt have time for me to argue! Btw he didnt know how to do a basic calculation he was using a calculator! As a person who has 2 college degrees and 2 minors in major ivy league schools, I felt really insulted and questioned myself even for being at the same level for communication with this Uneducated guy! I feel really sorry for him and this place, because Astorians award and value real good businesses really well, and you can see such as Taverna Cylacades, Queens Room etc.. But we also know how to punish BAD restaurants get shut down. If you want to do a favor for yourself just avoid this place because there are much better quality food restaurants at better prices than this! their meat has even no taste, its like shoe sole.The owner is now calling me loser lol  I arrived way before 7pm and told your hostess that I would use a Groupon voucher!! Groupon is a voucher that I purchased! It is not a Coupon!! You do not pay for a coupon! I paid money for that!! I am not eating for free!! I am eating with my own money!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Ma'am, Im calling you Ma'am because you sound like a very uneduacted NASTY old lady from the way of your talking! I don't need your CRAP food to fill my belly! It was terrible!! you guys even don't know how to cook American Style BBQ Meat. It was definitely something else. Now, I see how come your Manager can act that way. Because you are all the same! I will report you to the Yelp and your fake positive reviews get removed!!

Not only are they providing high-quality amazing food sourced from local grass fed farms WHO TREAT THEIR ANIMALS HUMANELY, but they have also stepped up their game during the whole pandemic here in New York City regarding COVID-19 quarantine To help their community by extending their delivery area to all five boroughs allowing people to order high-quality food outside of their local area. I have been a patron of Butcher Bar for the past 2.5 years as I am a cancer survivor and completely changed my diet two years ago eating only organic clean meat. This is how I found Butcher Bar, but to find out that their food also tastes amazing was a huge plus and has kept me coming back. I have always found their in house service to be very good an during the quarantine Chris in particular has been wonderful with every phone order that I've had. He has been very helpful and kind. I would recommend this restaurant to anybody who wants a high-quality meal at a fair price as well as supporting local farms.

Good BBQ and good service, though nothing really stood out for me here. I came by on a Sunday night with friends, and it was a nice dinner out.-House Dry Rubbed Ribs: the famous Sauced Ribs were already sold out when we came around Sunday 6pm so we decided to try the dry rub instead. Meat was smoky and tender, but definitely needed additional sauce on the side to kick it up a notch. -Animal Burger: juicy and tasty, but not memorable in flavor. In a week's time, I probably wouldn't be able to describe the burger to you...but I can say that the sauce in it was delicious! The menu mentioned that this burger is ""Always cooked Medium Well"", but we had the option to cook it differently if we liked.-Smoked and Fried Wings (with Sweet & Spicy Sauce): the smoked and fried combo sounded amazing on the menu, but tasted like solid, average wings in reality. I couldn't really taste the ""smokiness"" in them.-Sides: Mac and cheese was rich and creamy and the coleslaw/pickles was a light and refreshing side to pair with all the meat. If you order the cornbread as a side, it's sooooo much softer and more moist than the cornbread that comes with the Butcher's Platter (they're probably the leftover edges). Loved the honey butter as well.Staff here was very friendly and offered a complimentary warm apple cake at the end of our meal. It's practically cornbread once again, but topped with powdered sugar and a drizzle of apple syrup. Nice sweet way to end the meal."

From the moment I walked inside the staff was very pleasant and nice to me the entire time. I ordered the fried pickles and had a sangria pitcher to start off. The white sangria was very good and the fried pickles were so-so;I felt like they were fried a tad bit too much but I did have a few that were perfectly cooked but the sauce hat came with it was amazing. For my meal I had 'Gimmie the Beef' platter which came with burnt ends and brisket and I chose Mac n cheese as my side. I must say I thoroughly enjoyed the burnt ends but I feel like the brisket was under seasoned therefore wasn't overall that desirable. The Mac n cheese was good and the cornbread that came with it was also tasty. Their homemade BBQ sauces are also very goo They also gave me a complimentary apple cake for dessert and a shot of moonshine after dessert.

The food here is amazing, and you can see that from the reviews, but it is just so awesome when the customer service matches the quality of the food.My friend and I will be back and you will find us at the bar with Gina"

Instead of treating customers with some dignity and respect, Kathy calls them ""idiots"" and tells clients ""we hate idiots like you."" Instead of responding professionally, she tells her clients ""go somewhere else you nasty human."" I have never in my life experienced someone in the service industry talk down like this to paying customers. Whether or not the customer was right or wrong, you still can't talk to people like that. Period. Her nasty responses to yelp reviews shows what type of person she is. A professional manager would have responded positively, even to a negative review. I will never give another penny to this place or support such a foul mouthed, nasty person."

We recently went back this month of August 2018 and wasn't happy with the Order that we choose. The pickles had a Slimy substance on it that turned our stomach!! I kept my composure and tried the Philly Steak Sandwich. It grossed me out how that Added Mustard to replace the Cheese. I don't know what was going wrong with the dishes of food that we ordered. I asked the Waiter what went wrong and they replied that the Chef was new!! No Excuse!!! They used to be a restaurant in West Village that I always when to because of their Delicious Food about six years I was A regular Customer. Than....they had changed the Chef!! that was it!!! no more business from me. I'm hoping that Butcher Bar doesn't follow that mistake! I really love this place and I told SO MANY PEOPLE!! Friends Family and Work colleagues!! Please don't disappoint me again.

Inattentive staff, even though there was about 10 of them. Breakfast overrated, cocktails was basically sugar water. Lost me as a customer. Spend your cash else where.

My girlfriend and I ordered the Meat platter that comes with 1/4 pound of Burnt Ends and 1/4 Pound of brisket. For our side we got the Sweet Potato mash and the Brussel sprouts with bacon. If you check in on yelp you get a free side! The burnt ends were some of the best I've ever had, so moist and flavorful. The brisket was average, not much flavor and not as moist as I would've liked. The Sweet potato mash and Brussel sprouts were both delicious sides. The platter also comes with Cole slaw, pickles, and corn bread, all very tasty. The cole slaw does not contain a whole lot of mayo (My preference). At the end of our meal we got complimentary apple cake which was a generous gesture and a nice way to end the meal. I also recommend the Moonshine! So good. The happy hour here has some great deals so I would definitely come back for drinks!"

Came here and ordered the sample platter that came with a little bit of everything. You can choose your meat by the pound and with that you get sides to go along with it. We got the brisket, pulled pork, pork belly, and ribs. The brisket was moist and on its own was good but withe their BBQ was better. The pulled pork was a bit dry. It wasn't sitting in any sauce which really could have helped it along. The pork belly was crispy fatty salty and delicious. The ribs were NOT fall off the bone but they did have good flavor. It was a dry rub so its not dripping with sauce but we definitely added some BBQ sauce to it. Their sides are pretty standard. Your regular old mac n cheese. String beans were decent, the cole slaw was heavy with mayo, and the corn bread was just corn bread. We did order the beets which were unique. Tangy and sweet. Good foil to the heavy BBQ. Overall a decent BBQ spot."

ENDS!!!  My favorite BBQ place in NYC.  The burnt ends are so good they sell out during the day.  I thought that only happened in Texas.  Turns out the chef is from the Austin area so I can see why.  The burnt ends are packed with so much flavor are have a nice crunch on the outside.  I could literally eat them every single day.  the sauces are all amazing and I slather it on the burnt ends.  Not because they need them but because it's just so good.  I wished i lived around the corner.  Also, the cornbread with housemade honey butter is just unfair.  My girlfriend and I have ask for extra cornbread and extra honey butter after every meal we have had!  Place is no joke get there ASAP!"

The Apple cake is super good and complimentary for dinner (I think because of the previous reviews and because we received a large piece...but there is a story to that...). Corn bread was pretty good. Cons: The wait for our food took an hour (the place was not that busy), we ordered two sides, Mac and cheese and Brussels sprouts...we never received the sprouts. The burger was not juicy, I ordered a medium..it was more like a medium well. The food was just ok. So to not elongate this review, here is the story. We got there (two of us), were seated right away. Our order was taken, we ordered two burgers, Mac and cheese, and Brussels sprouts. One long hour later....and with no communication from the staff, we received our dinner, minus the Brussels sprouts. The waitress told us that it will come out in a min...like Maury says....""that was a lie"". We ate our entire meal and still nothing. When our waitress comes back we tell her and she apologizes and asks if we want it to go. We say no and she apologizes. They take it off the bill and give us the complimentary Apple cake.  They also added complimentary corn bread to go. I was disappointed because I expected more because of all the good reviews and stars. The lack of communication and the wait time was a bad experience. I will probably be going back to try their burnt ends because they look really good. Hopefully it's a better experience."

The worst part was that we came for happy hour and was only told that happy hour prices do not apply on holidays AFTER we got the bill... Honestly really disappointed."

I had finished work early and she was off....off to the butcher bar at 430pm... Perfect!! As soon as we walked in the place was mainly empty (trust me it's never like this we just happen to pick a sweet spot time to eat) the staff was really welcoming and the bar was a little warm for a 90 degree day but aaahhh who cares they have cold beer.As soon as we sat down we ordered our drinks, for me a Narragansett Lager and my GF a Cider Old Fashion... yeah I didn't know they make this combo. We both like to sit at the bar when possible...who knows best about the food than the bartender? She recommended a beef platter to share but we went with the Cubano Sandwich for her and Gimme the Beef platter for me. Sides were bacon beans and Mac and cheese. Reading the reviews before going I knew we were in for a treat. The Cubano Sandwich was delicious, the sandwich bread crispy and the meat and cheese all at perfect temps. The corn bread that comes with both meals is very good, I've had better but I'm not there for the corn bread. My platter was excellent, both meals were cooked just right, the dipping sauces are a nice touch...Beware of the Habanero sauce, not for the weak! Our sides were a mix, the bacon beans were outstanding and the Mac and cheese was good but I've had better, once again not there for the Mac and cheese. All told Cubano Sandwich, Meat Platter, two sides and four drinks...$92 including tip, keep in mind we were there for happy hour. A bit steep for a late lunch but very tasty. Oh yeah just as we were finishing up small crowds started wandering in...... Check Please!"

We had the Beef Brisket - amazing; meat candy - amazing; mac and cheese - surprisingly well done and not overly cheesy or salty; cornbread - delicious. The spicy sausage was sold out, we had the other one which was good, but not as special as the rest of the food.

Before I even put down my glass from my first sip of beer, the food had arrived. Was a little worried that my meal was just microwaved and served, but figured it's a popular dish and they had plenty of fresh-made available. The ""meat candy"" packed a lot of flavor, especially the outer coating and sauce. I did find the ends incredibly chewy however; almost jerky-like. The mac and cheese was definitely creamy as advertised - rich flavor, but I do wish there were some bread crumbs to provide a different texture to the side.Service here is excellent; was in and out of the establishment in about 25 minutes. Though I wasn't really blown away by the food, it's a solid choice for a late night meal in the area (Also free side with Yelp check-in!)."

The cheese and beef together was money. One of their better items $13BRISKET SANDWICH Their bottled sauces on the table are pretty good if mixed right so I like this dry rubbed no-sauced sandwich. I like to add my own for fear of getting an oversauced sandwich (get mopped and chopped if you prefer less work). $11REUBENNot bad. I love cole slaw with any smoked meats so this is right up my alleyPortions for side dishes could be bigger, very scant. Service is okay. They, of course, have ribs steaks and platter options. Great dinner option for those meat cravings without the hefty rodizio/churrascaria prices. Plus, they frequently have Groupon deals (groupon.com/biz/long-isl…) so great idea to save money while checking them out!Recommended: Philly Cheese Brisket, Bob's Burger, Creamy Mac, Sweet Potato Wedges"

I would say I am quite happy with the delivery time and the burger. It did bother me that the burger had shredded lettuce and everything was falling out. It was a little messy but I don't mind it. The burger was cooked perfectly and it tasted great! As for the Mac and cheese.... it was tasteless. No salt and it literally tasted like milky cheese with no salt. If it wasn't for the Mac and cheese I would of gave five stars.

Let me reiterate that this place has some of the best tasting barbecue meats and side dishes that I have consumed in a long time. I am currently having dinner somewhere else and would have gone to Butcher Bar if I had the energy to go to Astoria Queens at this hour!-lol. That is a true testament to exactly how fantastic the food is....I went there recently to have some of their famous Double Smoked Beef Burnt Ends. When I arrived, the lovely Bartender Julian informed me that they were sold out of Burnt Ends for the evening....I thought ""Oh No! What am I going to do without being able to order and eat Burnt Ends?-lol I had to think fast, so Julian recommended Smoked Pulled Pork. Wow, the Smoked Pulled Pork consisted of juicy succulent pork meat smothered in a mesmerizing barbecue sauce!!!! I licked my lips and fingers several times as I ate.....When you check in on Yelp, your side order is free! I had Cornbread w/ Honey Butter...it was hot and fluffy. Oh the creamy, sweet honey butter.....Julian was also kind enough to bless me with a slice of their Grand Mas Cake which was drizzled in Caramel Sauce!!! I enjoyed every bite! I just want to thank Julian for being so gracious, kind and hospitable. He was working hard behind the bar!!! How I wish there was a Butcher Bar in Brooklyn! Well, there is one in Manhattan....In the meantime, I will be heading to Astoria!"

BB does not break the chain here! We've been coming here since we moved to Astoria. Every time is has been as succulent as the next. On this day, my fiancée and I were STARVING. We could have eaten the floor boards, but we settled for the ""Butchers"" platter. What we got:-Mac & Cheese (Creamy. #1 side dish; I also love the fact they don't do those cheap breadcrumbs to lose the flavor)-String Beans sautéed in bacon fat (what's not to like here?!) MEATS:-Burnt Ends (or meat candy) -Brisket (perfect meat to fat ratio) -Pulled Chicken (least favorite...on the dry side) -Slaw and corn bread came with to settle our stomachs. Overall, outstanding joint on 30th Ave. This is our go to spot when we can't decide. Our waitress was also great! Catlin?! She was kind and even gave us a funny story. Drink prices were a bit high...maybe they should look into a drink special when you buy in bulk or hit a certain $ on your tab?"

My wife and I headed over to Astoria from Manhattan one Sunday afternoon to partake of their brunch. It was a fantastic experience made even better by our wonderful server, Christina B.! There is some fine print to the Groupon deal and she made us aware immediately of how we could get the most bang for our buck. Immediately she steered us in the direction of the burnt ends and Lord am I glad she did! She even instructed us to get two orders... we should've gotten 3 more orders... or 13 for that matter. They were melt-in-your mouth delicious. We've lived in North Carolina and Texas and this BBQ holds up well against some of the best I've had in both of those places. We ended up ordering two breakfast entrees and while tasty we'll probably just stick with BBQ next time. They were good but when you're at Butcher Bar just stick with what's tried and true, their barbecue. Drink prices were unreal, although when you use a Groupon you can't order off the happy hour menu. Next time, we'll scuttle the coupon and just order off the happy hour menu. All in all, we couldn't have been happier with our experience and we'll certainly be back for more!"

Two end burn meat was slightly sweet seasoning if you like sweet flavor, you will love it, meat very tender . Beef brisket was as well great. Mac&cheese is super cheesy, love it. I checked in on Yelp app and got free side I chose the famous Brussels sprout with bacon sprinkled.

I also ordered the macaroni and cheese which was quite good, but that wasn't the focus of the evening. The ribs and the brisket were quite bland and felt like they haven't even been smoked. It took forever just to get the ribs and brisket even though these sort of things are pre made. Anyways I've made much better ribs and much better brisket in my backyard, I definitely won't be coming back.  I don't know how they got these 'awards'.  This bbq was sub par. John Brown, Feta Sau even Mighty Quinn's make better bbq. What a shame..."

Good selection of unique and fun drinks, including a jalapeño margarita, which my friend said was fantastic. Overall, good barbecue food and an Astoria staple.

I am not sure what drove us to that choice but we just got in the car and drove to find a new place. Parking in Astoria is a battle. If you drive it might take some time find parking. We initially thought of Sugar Freak. The cajun brunch spot cross the street from Butcher Bar. We were enticed by the $14.99 per person boozy brunch ad.   We walked in and immediately seated but the place was busy. I am not a vegan but I am not a fan of seeing raw meat / butchered meat while I eat my burger. We asked to be seated elsewhere and was happily accommodated. The services staff was great, very cheerful and helpful which added to the experience. I ordered the brunch burger without any bacon and a bellini. We opted out of the boozy brunch to save the calories. My fiance ordered the BBQ chicken Sandwich with the Filipino sausage. My fiancé is Filipino and he was not impressed with the taste of the sausage. The food is good and tasty. So if your on a diet don't bother stepping into this place. You don't really have much healthy options. The menu if filled with delicious, finger licking and grease loving bbq food. I must say the fries are awesome and the brunch burger was good.  I am not sure, if we may come back but we did enjoy our experience."

The Monster, which was my 50/50 pulled pork & brisket sandwich, was too sweet and not the pull-apart tender people like in their BBQ - but a little extra spicy sauce fixed that right up.

We had the burnt ends to start, also pretty tasty. When it came for the main course, we ordered the porkys platter. Before the waitress could even set the plate on our table, you could tell the food was colder than Alaska in January and looked very unappetizing (even if it did come out hot). I get that this place is very crowded on the weekends and some of the platters are probably pre-made ahead of time but there is no reason to not have BBQ food come out hot. The food tasted even worse than it looked. I wouldn't bother wasting your time, there are plenty of cheaper better BBQ places a close ride away in LIC to check out."

I patronized the Butcher Bar this past Saturday & what a better way to start summer with even better food than I imagined! My boyfriend & I ordered the Mac & cheese which was cooked to perfection, I love smooth & creamy Mac & cheese & it was just that, we also ordered the fried pickles which came recommend by Chris whom by the way was super friendly, nice & helpful & he guaranteed me that I would NOT be disappointed & he was right, it came with a sauce on the side which it didn't even need because the pickles were so crunchy & tasty, lastly we had the Meat Candy"" Beef Burnt Ends & there are no words to describe how juicy, flavorful & tender they were (I think I just described it lol) the only thing I'd like to see different is the Butcher Bar possibly adding smoked wings to their menu cooked in the same rub as the brisket!!"

First off shout out to our waitress, she was the best, recommended some awesome sides - applewood smoked bacon beans, Mac n cheese, Brussels sprouts and checked up on our a good amount. When I was eating the half rack of fall off the bone I was literally thinking ""wow this was totally worth eating low carb / Keto diet"" and ""I really must be dreaming"" it was totally worth waiting for and I almost didn't even want to come thinking it wasn't available but calling ahead came to my aid! Aside from the awesome sides & main entree I also got the Narangansett lager and the apple pie bread at the end. Super satisfied. Thank you butcher bar!"

We sat at the bar after walking around looking for a bar. There are a lot of option but this was wasn't packed or completely dead. So the 3 of us girls took a seat. Our bartender(young guy, sorry didn't get his name) was really nice. He made some suggestions and took our order. So we ordered what tasted like a coconut margarita(from the machine) which was strong and delicious. My other girl ordered a Moscow mule, which was served in a cute metal like cup. She said it was good. Some time later...a couple more drinks...2 maybe 9 later we decided to munch on some food. Ordered some cheese fries and coleslaw(weird my girl ordered). The cheese fries are small but really taste good, the slaw was slaw. Then our amazing bartender served us Apple Pie Moonshine!!!! OMG!!!!! We were hooked!!!! So after 3 or 4 round of shots later, we ordered a plate of food to share. Blah, food is definitely NOT all that. No flavor on the ribs, brisket or even cornbread. My fellow Yelpers are right. BTW this place gets packed, like a wait and all. While we really enjoyed the bar & drinks here, I don't think we will be returning for any of the flavorless food. There are plenty of other food places to eat while Astoria but don't be discouraged to stop here, come for the Moonshine!!!!!!!!"

After going back & forth she offered me a $50 gift card if I removed my negative review. No thanks. I would rather be out $50 than to support a business with such a rude business owner.

I like the ambiance. Water and cocktails were good. Vegetables were probably the best part of our meal. ( the garlic broccoli and the Brussels sprouts.The brisket- dry, not much flavor. Really disappointing.Dry rubbed ribs- not much flavor but at least not dry.Bbq pulled pork- the bbq sauce is tangy for sure probably vinegar based so if you like that kind of bbq sauce then you'll probably like it. If you prefer smoky bbq sauce then probably not. We were hungry so obviously we ate our food but overall disappointing after reading reviews. The service was good. Although our cocktails came when we were basically done with our food so we were disappointed for that. But waitress was very pleasant. The 3 stars is mostly because the food wasn't as good as we were hoping."

I thought I was coming to get bbq but instead it was a bad imitation. Came with a group of three and we ordered a rack of their sauced ribs, 1/2 pound of brisket, half pound of burnt ends, Mac and cheese, fries, and corn. When there brisket came out I knew before I tasted it that it wasn't going to be good. Absolutely no signs of having been smoked (no smoke ring) and clearly it was very dry. The ""double smoked"" burnt ends were also dry and had no smokiness to them. The ribs were fall off the bone but were also dry and packed smoke flavor. The sides were average. The service was good but that doesn't make up for the poor quality of food especially when you consider how much they charge for the ""bbq"". Anyone looking for good bbq should steer clear of this place because they definitely are not serving bbq just some bad imitation."

The sauce so delicious, that I spent no time the entire meal muttering a sound, instead taking every second to enjoy and absorb the fantastic meal before me.The cornbread was moist and fluffy. The brussel sprouts simply wonderful, cooked to just the right amount of crisp, and an absolute compliment to the rest of the meal. Also the cole slaw was great. Oh and did I mention the service?

Everyone was very pleased with the food & the variety & we had plenty of doggie bags to take home. On the evening that we were there Chris  was in charge of our table. The service was even better than the food! Himself and his staff were very attentive. Our drinks never ran out & our food came out in a timely fashion. & not once were we rushed.

BB is reasonably priced for being an organic meat focused restaurant. I have been to the Astoria location twice and both times did have to wait for a table for about 20 min. The place is always crowded!!!! However once seated your order is taken promptly by a jolly server and the sandwiches are on point. My go to is a brisket sandwich ( can't you tell I love my Jewish roots ) Try to avoid ordering their Mac and cheese as it does not come out right. First time it was cold all around. Second time it was burnt on the outside and still cold inside. BB is not a place to order a dessert. Their apple pie is just as good as store bought or maybe it was purchased at C Town two blocks away.... who knows!!!Bottom line, get here early to satisfy your meat cravings!"

After being told that we would have to wait 20-25 minutes for a table for three on Friday night, we actually got in just 4 minutes later.When we were seated, Rory, our waiter, told us that there were no more burnt ends, which was super disappointing because that's all I read about on Yelp! In lieu of that, we ordered the pulled pork sandwich ($13), the monster 50/50 sandwich ($15) and the porky's platter ($25). I had the pulled pork sandwich, but I think we all agreed that the various meats were kind of dry, so we all had to use the original BBQ sauce which was on the table. The sauce was delicious, so that wasn't an issue, but I thought I would point that out.While I ate there, I thought that the prices were just a little bit high for the amount of food. Thinking back, though, it was probably worth it. Maybe I don't know BBQ, but I think it would be much more worth it if they knocked $1 off of each item. In any event, the food was delicious.Additionally, Rory was very friendly and knowledgeable. He gave us a rundown of all the meats when he first came by, and he hooked us up with an extra dessert even though we only ordered two. Rory is awesome! At the end of the day, I'll definitely be coming back, and that's saying something since I'm not a big BBQ fan!"

Worth a trip if in the area- perhaps I got them on an off-day.  Worth a repeat? I will pass."

We kept being told to wait 15 minutes and then the shift change took place and the new hostess didn't have a clue. They never apologized and we had no option but to walk out. Never again . Horrible place and management. Additionally, Look at their response. They are calling us idiots and associating us with Jon who we have no idea who that is and that statement alone should tell everyone the whole story. Save yourself the aggravations and go to another place. Bareburger around the corner is a whole new experience! Unfortunately 1 star is the only option we have as they deserve none!"

We ordered the fall off the bone ribs, chicken, burnt beef tips, Mac and cheese, and cornbread. First of all most of the food was lukewarm to touch. The cook seems lazy since he just threw a little bbq sauce on one side of the ribs. Portions were kid sized. I wasn't even full after ordering all that food. Service was okay, they never checked in. Only to order and to pay."

This spot is SMALL; limited seating + tables. It would help the hostess as well as guests with parties 3+ that she'd know how to utilize the space. There's NO reason to wait an hr or more for a table. There were single tables (couple seating) EMPTY while she sat party of 2's in booth spots (in the middle at that) only leaving more single tables available while abt 3 parties of 3+ were waiting. She actually seated a white family of 4 before us, who came AFTER us because we were 5 stating that the seating arrangement wouldn't allow 5 but she added that extra seat to the table we were finally seated & it was the same set up. Can't say she was racist cause she looked latina but definitely prejudiced! Which leads me to the next prejudiced staff, Lisa @ the bar! I sat at the bar to order a drink & she walked past me several times, didnt ask if I wanted a menu or anything. So I flagged down the guy (didn't get his name) he gave me menu and I ordered with him. I promise you not even 2 minutes after I ordered & the guy is STILL making my drink, Lisa presents me with the check! The same person who was ignoring my existence suddenly shows up! That's why I didn't feel bad for her when the white dude + his kid next to us  ran out on the bill on her. She ran outside to look for them but they were GONE! She obviously can't do her job well!The food: the appetizers are the BEST thing on the menu. Just do the bar (if they have HH) & go home.Pulled bbq chicken unflavorful.Smoked turkey no flavor!Mac & cheese = DO NOT ORDERMashed potatoes= okay One skirt steak was BURNT when asked for well done & the orders were mixed up. Apple crumb cake =you can skip itI've been to several cities in Texas & ate BBQ. This is the worse way you can represent! Do better butcher bar."

Thought it may have been a fluke, but I'd not recommend coming here if you're in the mood for some good BBQ. We ordered a handful of apps, meats and sides. The brisket was quite dry. The Cobb salad barely had any bacon - and this is a meat place. My boyfriend was also underwhelmed by the burnt ends. The Philly cheesesteak was okay (best among what we ordered), but just keep in mind the go-to BBQ items definitely aren't great. I will say the drinks are amazing. Great cocktails but not a good BBQ joint."

First, it's cold out so we couldn't go to a park or anything so I had to do my research on restaurants that are baby friendly. Butcher Bar was recommended to me (knives as door handles, baby friendly..CHECK). So we came and the ambient was perfect, I loved the southern barn feel. Then there are TVs so I was able to keep an eye on the football game. We got a seat immediately during a Sunday afternoon lunch time, so it means that the place is busy but not obnoxious where you have to wait 13 years for a meal. We got a 4 seater so score! The baby sat in his seat next to mommy on the bench against the wall. Both my friend and I got the brunch with one drink deal and both of us got Burnt Ends & Scrambled Eggs. It was perfect, just a good balance of juicy and crispy meat, eggs, potatoes and greens. I usually hate brunch food (I know, how could I?!), just sick of the the usual omelette, sausages, cheese and bacon combo..BORING. But this plate was perfect. The drinks did come a little late they are forgiven because the service and food was amazing.Overall I really would recommend this place, even the baby boy liked it! It's cozy, delicious meat, great service and I can't wait to have more burnt ends!"

It's a pretty laid back, casual restaurant. We ordered the appetizer that was similar to a KFC bowl (mashed potato, cheese, corn, chicken). This was good but not worth $12, it was a small portion that didn't have enough toppings, it was mostly mashed potatoes. Instead I would just order a side of the mashed potatoes for about $5, $6. I also ordered the brisket and Mac n cheese. The brisket was on the dry side and I wasn't crazy about the spices used. The Mac n cheese was good. My friend got a sandwich that was similar to a Philly cheesesteak that came w brisket, 3 cheeses and onions. It was good but very heavy, and again the brisket was on the dry side. It was a nice place but I'm not sure if I would come back."

It tasted of absolutely nothing. I get that not everyone likes sauce, I actually don't either, but I had to drown it to get any semblance of flavor. Tender, yes, but bland as hell. Pork belly also had no flavor, but fatty pork tends to be a bit more forgiving. Mac and cheese was still good, cornbread also great. Burger came with no fries, which is kind of ridiculous when you're charging $15."

Quick and super friendly service. To start, we got the ""meat candy"" appetizer of burnt ends which were tender and delicious; practically melted in your mouth. Definitely recommend!For my entree I ordered a Monster 50/50 which comes with a side of slaw and pickles. The burger was delicious and has an awesome kick to it because of the jalapeño. (Literally forgot to take a picture at first). Amazingly both the pickles and the cole slaw were also delicious. I also ordered a Mac and cheese (which they forgot initially but promptly served once they were notified) on the side and it was creamy and decadent. My date got the pulled BBQ chicken carvery and a side of the cornbread and honey butter and said she really enjoyed it as well. The pulled chicken has a lot of BBQ sauce and the cornbread was very moist and not dry. To top it off the waitress offered us a complimentary piece of the Grandma's Apple Cake as dessert which was really nice. Good cake but not necessarily something I would order on my own. Overall, it was a great experience and our waitress, Gina, was very sweet. Will definitely be back."

The burnt ends are supposed to be the thing to get there but both times I got them they were pretty flavorless, no smoke or anything. We also had the turkey burger which was very overdone (which is easy to do to turkey burgers) but it was also completely flavorless.My buddy got the ribs which he said were pretty good.  But the most surprising part was that the cornbread was really subpar. We get corn bread from Trade Fair when we make chili and it's exponentially better at the supermarket then at the bbq joint, very strange."

I got it with the burger and it ended up being around $15, which is expensive even though it comes with cole slaw, pickles, and cornbread. The burger was very good though. Burnt ends...slightly crispy, slightly sweet...yum! The biggest tip I can give is to make a Yelp account if you don't already have one and to check in because you get a free side just by doing so! That's like saving $5 with just a few clicks on your phone! I got the mac and cheese and it was really good. Very creamy and flavorful. Overall, I would say the prices here are a little high but the food is solid. Place is pretty spacious and clean. Rounding up because the server that I had was super friendly and attentive!"

We went in to Butcher Bar for a late dinner on a Sunday night, around 8PM. We are greeted nicely and chose to sit at the bar. We were 2 of the 4 people sitting at the bar. Upon being greeted by the bartender, it was quite obvious he was not sober. I was never given his name. I asked what rotating drafts they had, and he did not mention the holiday draft I could see directly behind him. I asked about it, he said he didn't know and offered for me to try it. I received the sample and ordered the draft. We then ordered dinner soon after, and chose to split the Gimme Beef. The kitchen was out of the burnt ends for the night, and we were offered ribs in replacement. We accepted them, though it is not what we would have preferred. We then ordered a margarita, but the bartender never made it. He played on his phone instead. The food came out and the ribs, brisket and Mac and cheese were all cold. The coleslaw was too salty. We ate our food without complaint, mostly because the bartender was nowhere to be found. We finished our food and I stacked the plates, the bartender watched from the computer at the end of the bar, again on his phone. He never came down to take the plates or offer the check. Soon after he walked outside and came back a few minutes later with friends behind him, and sat at a table and chatted with them while ignoring us. I had to ask a server, Emily, for our check. She was pleasant, understanding and apologetic about the situation. Emily offered to make us the drink we never received, but we declined because we were ready to leave. Emily kindly closed our check and we never saw the bartender again. Would not recommend."

It was my number 1 bottomless brunch spot for almost 2 years. My boyfriend and I went almost every weekend for the mimosas, the Burnt ends & scrambled eggs. I recently went on vacation for 2 weeks and when I returned I was disappointed to hear that they discontinued Bottomless Brunch. They now have more drink and food options which I guess was aimed at getting more customers but as a regular there it was a major blow. I noticed they also had new brunch staff that weren't as experienced and a little slower than the normal people (I know service industry has a lot of turnover). My food also came out a little cold which is unusual for them. Other than that 1 bad experience the food and service of this place has always been great. However I don't think we will be back as often now that the bottomless is gone."

It's a decent and reliable place, but definitely not my personal favorite BBQ. I've tried a variety of their BBQ meats. Rib meat is dryer than I'd like and it's happened on more than one occasion, though I may have to try the ""sauced"" ribs rather than the dry-rub. The BBQ sauce is on the sweeter side with almost no complexity of flavor. I have been similarly disappointed by the side of beans; they are just too sweet and one note for me (I also have the bar set high - I'm pretty obsessed with Mighty Quinn's burnt end beans).Onto the good: mac and cheese is good, as is the corn bread. And the key lime pie dessert? TO DIE FOR DELICIOUS.Will I order from here again? Yes, but I may stick to a few items and branch out for others."

I was going to address the situation on the spot but didn't want to cause a scene or embarass the hostess. I have no problem speaking my mind and when she told me to wait while she checked, I assumed she already spoke to who ever was in charge. Didn't feel like I had to ask again and again. Once should have been enough. Nevertheless, I'm changing to four stars simply based on your  kind and professional gesture and offer.  Hopefully she can learn from this experience so your business can thrive on overall service. She may not earn in tips but the wait staff does and her decisions can affect what they earn and needs to know that. It isn't fair but it does happen. I've seen it firsthand as a waitress myself years ago. Keep up the positive  and inviting hospitality...it can go a long way."

Once you walk in you will feel comfortable and see families eating or friends hanging out grabbing a bite or maybe even people having a business lunch or dinner. It's that kind of vibe. Now for the food. To die for. I always get ""Gimmie the Beef"" it's burnt ends and briskets with some other things but it's just delicious. The Mac and cheese here is also very good.

Its not 100% traditional Filipino longanisa but its delicious, especially paired with their cornbread. I wish I could eat it daily. Also ordered a side of mac and cheese because I was clearly in a gluttonous mood and was not disappointed. My friends ordered dishes with brisket and bbq chicken and they were flavorful as well.

After reading all the reviews, my family and I decide to go to this restaurant. We got a table, the waitress came and took our order and said the side order came with the meal. We waited a long time for our food to arrive was problem # 1. Problem # 2 since they took a long to bring our food you would think the food would be hot!!! Nope, it was cold. I ordered the dry rub ribs because I like tasting the season on the ribs before I add bbq sauce to it. The ribs had NO flavor and then added their bbq sauce to the ribs it still couldn't help these ribs taste good. I also ordered the beef brisket, but my waitress forgot to bring it with our order. I let her know and she ask if she could bring it to me now, I said no thank you. The mac & cheese tasted like it was made using government cheese ( if you never heard about government cheese look it up). My family also was unhappy with their food. We got chance for the sides ordered, so I guess it doesn't come with the meal. I was already upset with the whole experience we paid and just walked out; I left a note because I didn't leave a tip with the reason why I didn't leave a tip. When I got home, I did call the restaurant to explain the note I left. The manager was very friendly and said she wish we would have told her when we were at the restaurant. She stated that she would have changed all of our meal if we were unhappy with the food.Sorry, Kathy, I am a real customer that was at your restaurant today for my birthday. Everything I wrote in my comment was accurate. How dare you try to discredit a customer just because I wrote my experience at your restaurant today. Kathy, instead of you trying to clip-back at a custom. You should be making to correction at your restaurant so other customers won't be unhappy with their food and service like we were. It just shows how unprofessional you as a manager really is."

It came with choice of sides: corn on the cob, and mac & cheese. *Fall off the bone Ribs w/ coleslaw and opt for side of sweet potatoes*1/4 double smoked beef burnt endsTotal: $70.00 w/ tax The portions were pretty small especially for the beef burnt ends. Though it was delicious, it only contained a few pieces. It was pricey compared to other items. The pulled pork was juicy and full of flavor. Unfortunately, the beef brisket and grilled chicken breast was too dry. We had to smother it with BBQ sauce. The ribs were good and plentiful. My daughter end up devouring 2 pcs along with the beef burnt ends. She's a really picky eater. We were surprised that she willingly ate the meat. The sides were great esp the mac & cheese. It was creamy with a touch of cayenne pepper. The only downfall for us was the sweet potatoes. It was very damp and sticky. It looks like it had been marinated in a sauce for too long. Taste-wise, it was a bit off. I do like that they use organic and locally sourced quality meats. So that factors in the cost. However, for take-out the platters and sides are way too small. Not sure if the portions are bigger when you eat in. Hub did noted the staff was attentive and offered water or soda while waiting for the pick-up. Def will return for their ""candy"" burnt ends and other items! I would give it 3.5 stars for the first try. Hopefully, we'll get a chance to dine in another time and compare if the portions varies."

She was truly amazing and figured out how to order almost all the stuff I originally wanted just under different names. They put it together so quickly and with such great customer service. I would venture back here and I don't even live in the area. Aside from my ordering fiasco, there's a lot of things to like about Butcher Bar. Their meats are organic, grass fed, and pasture raised. We tried pretty much everything that was available at the time- the pulled pork, dry and wet ribs were the best. Brisket was ok and grilled chicken was a little dry. Pickles and slaw were great, Mac n cheese could've been cheesier. The restaurant is wide open and just big enough to fit a brunch crowd comfortably. Can I mention the changing table in the ladies room?! After lots of baby wrestling on restaurant bathroom floors it's much appreciated."

As far as stars go I'm between 4 and 4.5 - but I'm not ready to bump it up to 5 until I go back and check out their ""Meat Candy"" Beef Burnt Ends and their ""Butcher Bowl"" (mashed potatoes, fresh corn & jack cheese topped w/your choice of Smoked Pork or BBQ Chicken.)Last Saturday I came here for dinner with my fiancé after a fun filled day in Brooklyn. We were planning on going to one of my favorite Italian food restaurants but the MTA had different plans for us so we decided to go here. He had been here for cocktails and I had been here...never - although I truly, truly, truly regret not checking them out back when they were BYOB - (RIP because now they sell booze themselves).As my entree I ordered their Half Baked Mac & Cheese off of their appetizer menu. They describe it as being their famous creamy mac & cheese, oven baked in a cast iron skillet topped w/ grass fed beef chili, bacon bits  & jack cheese. I asked for the chili on the side because I worried that if it was too spicy then it would ruin the meal for me.The waiter asked me if we were sharing it and I responded back that I was gonna treat this cheesy sucker as my main meal. He was concerned that I wouldn't be able finish it all on my own. He also stressed that this was a serving for two and that I would not be able to handle it all on my own...yeahhhh...he clearly doesn't know me, lol. I stood firm in my order.My sweetheart ordered their Smoked Ribs. There are two options here - House Dry Rubbed and Fall Off The Bone Sauced and he opted for the latter. On BB's menu they are described as being ""smoked til they fall off the bone"" and ""sauced just right"". He gave me a rib and I've gotta say, IT TOTALLY FELL OFF THE BONE aaaaaaand WAS SAUCED JUST RIGHT!! Lol. These ribs are easily in the top 3 ribs I've ever had at a restaurant. Yes, they were that good.My mac and cheese was delightfully creamy and I'm happy to report that while the beef chili had a little bit of kick, it was totally fine for me! Trust, my tolerance for spicy anything isn't great and their chili was super flavorful and generously meaty. The mac also came with crispy bacon bits (of kind of thick cut bacon...sooooooo not complaining here!) and was really good without being overpowering. We also shared sides of mashed potatoes and their french fries (go hard or go home, amirite?). The mashed potatoes were really delicious and made chunky with the skins on - just the way I like em'. The fries were unbearably salty for me. I could barely get through 4 or 5 before throwing in the french fry towel. I did like that they were clearly hand cut, with the skin on and rather thick. Just a little less salt tossed in next time would make me a happier camper.Both my fiancé and I really enjoyed our meal here. Even though it was like a 20 minute wait  to get a table - it was a Saturday around 7ish - so totally understandable. Everyone was great from the hostess, to the bartender, to our really attentive and personable waiter. Great service, great food and located in a fantastic location. Anyone giving Butcher Bar 2 stars and a place like Dallas BBQs 4 needs a palette readjustment because it's like comparing Morton's Steakhouse to Burger King (*sips her tea* just my opinion, lol).I love you Butcher Bar and I can't wait to be back! :)"

The place was pretty packed for Sunday night around 6pm.. I'm not sure if it's cause everyone is redeeming their Groupon. Around 6:30pm or so, there were maybe 5 people waiting in line to get a seat.Here's what we got:- ""Meat Candy"" burnt ends $14: Good, but I think my friend would've liked more meat in the sandwich- ""The Monster"" 50/50 brisket & pulled pork combo $15: This was humongous and I'm surprised I was able to stuff everything in my mouth (heh heh). But with the soft buns and lavishly drizzled BBQ sauce, nothing is impossible.- Mac and cheese side: Very well made. It was cheesy yet milky at the same time, making it actually pretty substantial.- Sauteed bacon & onion string beans: They said it was one of their specialties but honestly, I didn't think it was anything special.Original BBQ and Sweet & Spicy BBQ sauce are already on the table (they're delicious). You can ask for Habanero sauce but BEWARE it's actually REALLY REALLY hot and numbing (and I love spicy). Coleslaw, pickles and cornbread already come on the side with your sandwich.Yelp check-in for a free side! Though they didn't let us use it with the Groupon :(Bathroom rating: 9/10 - very spacious and clean, but I think there's only 2 bathrooms total (1 male, 1 female)."

I wasn't a fan of the ribs or Mac n cheese. The meat on the ribs didn't fall off the bone and felt a little dry. And the side Mac n cheese lacked in flavorSecond visit: I ordered the half baked Mac & cheese entree and I was not disappointed! It tasted much different than the side order of Mac and cheese. This Mac n cheese comes with beef chili and I also ordered a side of brisket and mixed that into my Mac & cheese.... so yummy!!!! My friend ordered a rack of ribs and those were deliciously juicy and fell off the bone unlike the previous time I had ordered them.I do recommend to go early or call in ahead of time because they ran out of burnt ends the second time I went and I was so upset!

Service was great. We ordered smoked and fried wings(habanero), Half baked mac and cheese, PBLT(pork belly, lettuce and tomato). 1/4lb of brisket and 1/4lb of burnt ends.Half baked mac and cheese and burnt ends was a well deserved of a 5 star. We were looking forward to burnt ends and it did not fall any less of our expectations. Extremely flavorful, no sauce needed. Half baked mac and cheese with the baked beans and bacon bits, compliments it very well. Wish there was a little more bacon mixed in.Only reason why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 was because the PBLT(pork belly sandwich) was bland. Had to add some of the original BBQ sauce on it. Tips to the restaurant, add a more savory sauce on it. Brisket was nice and juicy but bland and lacked flavor that it was necessary to dip in the BBQ sauce. The habanero wings was not spicy, we could taste the habanero flavor but was hoping there was a spicy kick rather than a tangy kick. Not bad, but I guess we have higher expectations on the spicy tolerance. Also they have a 5 dollar special of a shot and beer. A moonshine(with flavor) and a Narragansett lager. Absolutely an amazing happy hour deal. Btw this is an everyday deal between 3-6pm. We will be back!"

We were so satisfied with everything. They forgot the gravy but the potatoes were so smooth and buttery that I didn't even need it! The string beans were soo flavorful. The burnt ends were crisp on the outside but juicy and tender. Highly recommend. The service was top notch. They were attentive without being hovering and so friendly in general. To make things even better, they offered a complimentary dessert! I was stuffed but magically made room for the apple cake. And oh my God. Soft, warm, not too sweet with the best glaze on top.

I've never been much of a corn bread lover though have tasted my fair share of corn bread because both my mom and fiancé love corn bread. It is seriously THE BEST corn bread ever! Besides the amazing corn bread my fiancé and I had the Porky's with a side of Mac & Cheese, Sweet Potato Wedges, and bread pudding for dessert. The Porky's comes with ¼ lb. pulled pork, ¼ lb. pork belly & ¼ rack of ribs. We had the dry rub ribs because they were out of the wet ribs (it was the 4th of July and they were really busy).  All three meats were excellently seasoned and cooked to perfection. The pork belly was crispy, the ribs were falling off the bone, the mac and cheese was creeeeamy. The Cole Slaw was great with the meal and by itself. There was no overpowering taste in the slaw, you could taste all the different ingredients, which is quite a feat. My only suggestion is that they offer the sweet potato wedges as a dessert. Don't get me wrong the sweet potato wedges were great! However, to me they reminded me, and tasted like, a sweet potato pie only in a wedge form. The sweet potatoes were really sweet and they added sugar and cinnamon, making them a dessert in my opinion. They didn't fit well with our meal so we ate them after we were done with the BBQ. Since we had the sweet potato wedges as dessert we took the bread pudding to go and had it a couple days later. The bread pudding was ok. We should have had it at the restaurant. Overall the service was ok but the food was delicious!"

My favorite meat was undoubtedly the ribs. They had a delicious smokey flavor as evidenced by the meat and bone color. The outside had a perfect char, and the meat was so tender. To top it off, the ribs were smothered in a delicious BBQ sauce. The sauce was so good that I decided to take some home on my pants.The burnt had had an excellent char and was super crispy. The brisket went well with the table sauces, but I'd definitely order the ribs when I return. We also had an order of their delicious Mac n cheese. It was so creamy with the perfect viscosity. I'd certainly recommend the Mac n cheese as well. The staff was accommodating and helpful. Our waitress was attentive and made us feel very comfortable. The draft list has offerings from breweries like Fat Tore and UFO. The bathrooms were clean and spacious."

However, the consistency is a bit liquidy so if you prefer your mac and cheese dry then you might not like it. Otherwise, it's very creamy and cheesy. The chicken tenders are also really tasty - they're juicy and fresh. I haven't had anything else from here but I can't wait to try some actual meat!"

Since today was such a beautiful day for a walk, my husband and I ventured over to finally try it. When you walk in through the gates then the alleyway to get to the restaurant entrance all the way in the back, it feels a bit odd but they did try to spruce it up but having some decorations outside and also seating. As you walk into the restaurant, you can already tell its a very small space. Just 3 tables that seat 2 each and a bar table that seats 3 or 4 I think. The menu is quite small which I like because then you're not overwhelmed with so many choices. Quality over quantity.We ordered the crab soup dumplings, shrimp dumpling and scallion pancake with beef. We just really wanted to get a taste. I must say everything was delicious! The presentation was not all that but I think its because they're more of a take out or delivery place. The scallion with beef was delicious..crispy but not oily and beef was super tender. The dumplings were also delicious! Soup dumpling soup was savory and warming. We would definitely come back or order from here again. Just a bit hard if you're driving here because....well it is forest hills. I think walking here is perfect if you live close or also just ordering take out."

The rice cake had fresh bamboo slices!  Not canned bamboo.  That added a whole other dimension to this classic dish that almost all other places miss. Their chive pancakes were actually stuffed full of chives.  Most other places  stuff it with mainly vermicelli, with just a bit of chives.  Again, they were just so fresh and fragrant.  The scallion noodles, however, took the honors.  I have to say it again.  It was just so fragrant and flavorful.  The chef fried the scallions until the were brown and crispy.  It's tossed on top of the noddles along with some greens and a couple dried shrimp for extra flavor.  We all shared everything.  But, I swear I'm going to get my own bowl of scallion noodles next time, which is probably next week.  LOL.  I also saw another customer with a bowl of curry beef with vermicelli soup  that looked amazing.  Gotta try that next time too.  Can't wait!"

Two orders of braised beef noodle in soup and one shanghai sticky rice shaomai. Tasted fine, but one of the beef noodle soups only had two small pieces of meat. The other had five. For $9.25, given the quality of the meat, I would be fine with five pieces but not two. Many other places nearby sell this item at the same price, same quality, but with more meat. Delivery isn't ideal, but the noodles arrived as a giant sticky clump. If you try to separate the noodles from themselves, you won't be successful. So enjoy eating all of the noodles before you notice that there isn't much protein underneath. The shaomai was overpriced.I'm sure the food would be better if I sat down and ate there. But would it be more consistent? I don't think I'm willing to find out unless I'm already a few blocks away."

I think maybe when the weather is better they will put out table and chair to seat outside. From what I tried so far I believe what they offer will not be bad if not great. Seems to be a family run shop that cares for what they offer.

Great ""hole in the wall"" dim sum place, it's literally located in an alley way and feels super authentic with a modern twist. It's super small place with only 2 tables inside but they do have some tables outside to eat at as well, which is probably better for nicer weather. Probably best with small groups or for take-out/delivery.We ordered the veggie pot stickers, xia long bao, shao mai, and chili wontons. Each dish came out to between $6-$8 each. We also had taro and pumpkin pancakes for dessert. Not sure if it's because we waited too long to eat the dessert (it came out first) but they were a little too dry for my taste.

It's a self serve place, order your food, and find a place to sit down and enjoy. Everything we had today was tasty, the pork stuffings had very good flavor, and not greasy.

It's a short walk from the forest hills subway station and on the strip of the busy Austin street. As you approach the spot you will see 2 big banner or flags that specify its name. Right next to a parking garage. You can't miss it. As you walked further in you can see some outdoor seatings which is good for the summer time. We came a little after 12pm on a Sunday and there were plenty of seats. At most you can sit up to 14 people. The menu is on the wall or you can take the paper version from the cashier. Once you are ready make your order and take your receipt. When your order is ready they will call your number. What we order: Pork soup dumplings: ($6.75) (6 pieces) the soup was delicious and very flavorful, just the right amount of pork fillings. Crab soup dumplings: ($7.75) (6 pieces) usually at every soup dumplings spot we go to we eat the pork first and we always end up loving the crab. But at this spot, we ended up loving the regular one more. There just wasn't enough of crab to spark the dumpling. It was still good but needed more crab in the mixture of filling. Scallion pancake with beef: ($6.25) maybe like 2 pieces of sliced beef which was wrapped in scallion pancake. The pancake was crunchy on the outside and they put the hoisin sauce inside the beef.  After you're done dispose the chopsticks and the sauce cup, return the spoon and the bamboo steamer basket to the cashier.

Generous amount of noodles, the beef is so tender and the broth is really flavorful. You can have it spicy or not which is a good option for my 2 year old toddler. The soup dumplings were not bad at all. The rice cakes were just ok thou, a little bland for my taste. Skip on the curry vermicelli noodles. This place is a good option if you dont feel like venturing out to Flushing to satisfy your soup dumplings and beef noodles cravings!

Sounds cliche but my favorite soup dumpling place is Joes Shanghai (yes, I like it more than Shanghai Cafe in Chinatown and Nan Xiang Xiao on Prince St). While I don't think these soup dumplings are as good as Joes, they do compete with Nan Xiang or other less-known places. The wrapper wasn't too thick, but thick enough to hold the dumpling so it doesn't fall apart. Both the pork and crab had great flavor and a good amount of soup in it. My only con, which is forcing me to give MOS 4 stars instead of 5, is that they don't give you proper soup spoons, they are way too small and lead to make a mess while eating. They also don't give you cabbage, which I like to have to soak up any soup that spills.Other than that, I tried the scallion pancake with beef and that was perfect; perfect crisp without feeling too oily and just enough hoisin sauce to give it flavor but not overpowering.The steamed chicken dumpling with curry and onion was a must have!! Such a unique flavor and good consistency. I almost ordered a second order.The shaomai with sticky rice and mushroom was also delicious. I would also order it again.Lastly, I got the panfried noodles with seafood. It wasn't my favorite but pan fried noodles never are so I can't be a good judge. My gf said the noodles were a little too chewy. The amount of vegetables and seafood was also a little lacking.For a small little forest hills spot, definitely excellent and as a forest hills person, I would definitelUpdate: they changed to regular soup spoons!!!"

When it comes down to it the food was great. The soup dumplings have a clean broth that don't make your teeth feel disgusting after eating them. As long as you try to eat them while they're hot, they don't fall apart while you're picking them up (aka hearty skins) and the flavor is on point. The scallion pancakes were pretty standard. The fried rice cakes were actually amazing. I was so surprised, because I was disappointed that they didn't have meat, but the flavor was really on point for it. Seating is a bit weird. Definitely more of a summer place when you can sit outside, but wouldn't recommend bringing more than 4 people. Even 2 people will be hard to get a seat, and then if you take away the soup dumplings, it'll be weird to eat them cold. That's the only downfall of this place. Also don't be concerned that you're walking down a well lit nice alley way. You're going the right way. Overall it lost a star for the seating and also the prices are higher than what you would pay in Flushing. But for any time I don't feel like going to Flushing (which is most of the times) I would definitely come here to get my fix."

There is one four-person table, 2 two-person tables, and a few counter seats, and the kitchen space is so small, the counter space quickly disappeared under bags of takeout orders. (There are tables outside, so during summer months, I imagine the place feels less cramped.) Yet somehow, Memories of Shanghai manages to churn out lovingly prepared dishes that would make any Shanghainese native nostalgic for home.Standout dishes included the 牛肉卷饼 (I think they called it ""夹饼"" on their menu), or scallion pancake with sliced beef - the pancake was so crispy, airy, and flaky, one of the best scallion pancakes I've ever had. We would have liked a bit less sauce and a bit more beef, but would 100% order it again. The 上海小笼包 were excellent - the skin was so thin and delicate, the filling was generous and flavorful, and the soup had that perfect, mouth-coating gelatinous quality. The 蟹粉小笼包, or crab meat soup dumplings, could have used a bit more crab flavor, which was more of a faint aftertaste. The 生煎包, or pan-fried dumplings, were very tasty, but the bottoms were not quite crispy. We also had sweet soy milk (甜豆浆) and savory soy milk (咸豆浆), both served hot - some patrons stopped in just for the soy milk, and after taking a sip, you'll totally understand why.For the price, this place can't be beat. Everything we ordered was under $7 and reminiscent of the good home-style cooking found in Shanghai alleys of old. I desperately wish a place like this existed in Washington, DC, and look forward to stopping in again, hopefully in the summer months, to inhale copious soup dumplings with some more elbow room outdoors."

First though, it is way down on Austin street. About a 10 minute walk from the subway. But it's worth it. The dining room only sits a couple of people literally. And you're up close to where they are making the dumplings. That's very cool. I started off with a scallion pancake. Normally when I have had them they are always greasy. But it isn't here. It's so good!! I wish the sauce was a bit thicker but it's still delicious. Jeffrey got the beef noodle soup and he had them make it very spicy. They really did. He actually started getting red in the face. Funny but worth it!!Then I got the shrimp dumplings. They were so good!! The shrimp was very large and the dumpling pastry was delicate. Just the way it's supposed to be. I wanted to try a sweet puff but I'm apprehensive as in almost every Chinese sweet party I have never found one yet that was sweet. Maybe next time I'll give it a chance. Hey MOSH we will definitely be back!!!"

My only gripe is that I had a thirst after eating them which I guess was from the MSG. But what's Chinese food without MSG. Definitely my new go to place for soup dumplings. Also their chive pancakes are EXCELLENT. Crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside. It looks like a big dumpling but it taste really good.

We ordered the scallion pancake with beef, the soup dumplings, the shrimp dumplings, and the beef noodle soup with bok choy and asked for it spicy, and for $30 total for two people we left stuffed! I loved the beef scallion pancake and the soup dumplings the best, and my boyfriend loved his spicy beef and noodle soup. When they say ""spicy"" they are serious, it was a good amount of heat with plenty of kick. The soup dumplings are adorable, not too big, not too tiny, and the thickness is just right where they don't burst when you try to pick them up, but you can easily bit into them and slurp out the soup without it spilling all over everywhere.As people have mentioned this place is TINY, but it is fresh, homemade, and with a limited item menu. If you have a spare afternoon, I highly recommended taking the train or a drive out to Forest Hills, park near Austin Street, get some dim sum at memories of shanghai, and then walk around the neighborhood."

I order from them a lot, and the delivery is always very fast. Their beef noodle soup is my favorite in NYC, if you like a little spiciness in your noodle soup, then definitely give it a try. I also had their sesame pancake, spicy wonton, fried rice, they are all delicious. The price there is very reasonable as well."

It's about a seven minute walk from the 71st Street subway station, five or so from the Forest Hills LIRR station, so it's well away from the throngs of people on Austin Street. It also does not even have a store front; it has a sign and the actual restaurant is about a 15 yard walk past where a normal restaurant's entrance would be.The place is well kept with a very spartan decor. It's also tiny, seating about 6 people at two tables and four at the bar. There is seating outside at two other tables, so it's the usual ""great on nice days, not viable when it's cold or raining"". Plus the LIRR is less than 10 yards behind the restaurant so when the trains go roaring by...I would definitely rank this as the best dim sum I've had in New York as far as overall quality. I've come across some other places in Flushing and Chinatown that come close, but I prefer this restaurant. The people making these tasty morsels are experts at their craft, for they are not some dough-heavy wads, nor are they so thin that they pop like a teenager's zit when you pick them up with your chopsticks. The steamed chicken dumplings with peanut butter are utterly heavenly, with a hint of said peanut butter, not a gummy and overpowering blob of it, the pork and vegetable wontons are are delicious, and the pork wontons in chili sauce have a nice kick to them. The beef noodle soup also really hits the spot, especially on a cold winter day.In summation, to say I'm a fan of this place is like saying water is wet, and I love the fact this place is about a three minute walk from me as of this update. If you want some great Chinese food for a good price and don't want to go scouring in Chinatown or Flushing, here ya go."

For the soup dumplings, flavor was on point but the skin was faulty. Overly thick like joe's shanghai and they were so big, they were touching which caused them to stick to one another and break. Scallion pancake with beef was the best we've ever had! Size is smaller than usual but the skin was extra flaky and crispy with a generous amount of sauce. Beef Noodle soup was savory with just enough spice. Beef could've been a tad less chewy though. Prices are average and affordable."

Groups of 1-4 will have the best chance of getting a seat. Everything here is made from scratch daily so you'll often find some dimsum menu items no longer available if you go too late in the day.Soup dumplings are pretty good here; skin is a bit thick for my liking, but not that much thicker than nan xiang's (which closed down T__T)I like the size of their menu and the fact that they're not trying to do too much.As for pricing, probably $1-$2 more than what it would cost in Flushing, but it saves me the trip.

I would say it is on par with food in flushing actually. The soup dumplings are full of juice, and the hot and sour soup has good ingredients in there.They are cautious to remind people that one of their sauces has peanut in it but if you're not allergic to peanuts, I would highly recommend the pork wonton in chili sauce (it isn't actually that spicy). If you want something soupy, pork wonton soup is also great.It is definitely quite a walk from where most of the shops are on Austin street though, but I drove so it didn't affect me. Ample parking where they are located usually since its far apart from the other shops."

Formerly occupied by Tokyo Teriyaki, it literally is a tiny Shanghainese dim sum (snack) shop with two extra outdoor tables in an alleyway between the 108th police precinct and an underground parking lot. As for the gem part, let me explain.First of all, I am Shanghainese and my mom is a former dim sum chef in Shanghai, China. Therefore, my family likes to try every new Shanghainese dim sum restaurant that opens in NYC. Thankfully, this place is better than most in the five boroughs and it's minutes from my home.Instead of trying to do a million things, they were smart to stay away from too many cooked dishes and stuck with Shanghainese dim sim. Not everything is fantastic, but what is done well beats 90% of what's out there. My family's favorites are both soup dumplings, pan fried dumplings, sticky rice shaomai, radish puffs, and the awesome xie ke huang puff.The owner was the original head chef of the popular Shanghai You Garden in Flushing. They make everything daily fresh from scratch, and some of the items run out quickly. If you want something specific, you may want to call and order in advance. Not sure I should be sharing this tip since it might prevent me from getting what I want. Oh well! Enjoy!"

Our family decided to come try this place since there are no nearby Shanghainese cuisines in the area. It's a tiny place that looks the same as it's previous Tokyo Teriyaki occupant. We were able to get our stroller down as there were three tiny tables and bar seating. The outdoor space to dine is super cute at night. Pork soup dumplings - wasn't expecting much but this was good. Done to the way we love our dumplings - thin enough skin, great broth and good chunk of meat. So good, we ended up placing three orders total. Scallion pancake - another pleasant surprise. Great texture, crispy, and cut into cute tiny triangular pieces. Dipping sauce comes in a separate container. Pan fried seafood noodles - be careful because the lid can be hot! I managed to sting my hand trying to get this open due to the heat inside the container. Not your average presentation for pan fried noodles as the noodles weren't as crunchy as we expected but still good. Noodles decked out with sauce, scallops and vegetables. Not bad. Pan fried buns - this was delicious. We try this dish everywhere even though it takes a long time since it's freshly made. Super soft bread with a slight crunchy, seared bottom. The meat inside was just enough to eat with the carbs and nicely seasoned. Certainly a favorite of mine. Staff was friendly and helpful, especially when we were navigating the menu and figuring out what to get. Mad props for that fancy credit card machine where you can swipe or insert your card. Wasn't expecting that at all!Overall, this tiny place surpassed our expectations. Takeout is tough because you do want to eat it fresh while you can so I'm hoping they can expand some of their outdoor seating. The quality of the food is there and it is wonderful to have a Shanghai option in the neighborhood."

They don't have a big dine-in area, as there are 2 tables outside and 12 crowded seats inside.The restaurant looks operated by a family from Shanghai. The staffs are friendly and the service is reasonably quick.I tried their steamed soup dumplings and pan fried buns. The soup dumplings were generally OK. The dough was thin enough but easy to get broken. The spoon they provided was just too small and kind of annoying. The pan fried buns did not meet the expectation, with too less soup inside.The pricing is 10-20% higher than Flushing, while tip is unnecessary. The good thing is they accept credit card.I'd say the food quality is not as good as their peers in Flushing, but they should have no problem to survive in Forest Hills, cause we don't have other authentic Shanghai restaurants in the neighborhood."

The food is awesome, but the small indoor space made dining tough to enjoy.Quality: Delicious food. The only item I did not like was the Spring Rolls.

So much more to try on the menu, and from the crowd reactions everything is great.Quantity: Always tough to judge how much to get with dim sum. Don't be afraid to go up for more if you underestimate.Value: $6.25 for Steamed Soup Dumplings. $6.25 for Pan Fried Pork Buns. $4.25 for Spring Rolls. $6.55 for Pork Wonton in Chili Sauce. $5.55 for Scallion Pancake With Sliced Beef.Ambiance: Memories Of Shanghai is located on Austin Street in Forest Hills, but slightly off the main stretch. Down a small alley, they have an outdoor seating area, but it was too frigid to use on this evening. Instead everyone was packed into the small and tight indoor space. You will likely have to fight for a seat or get your meal to-go during standard meal times.Crowd: Small space with a lot of people. Probably better on warmer days and nights when the outdoor can be used.Service: Food comes out as ready. No table service, grab your meal at the counter.Parking: Right near the police station, so most of the street parking is taken up by police cars."

Okay, so rewind a bit and think about it.  You are in a tiny restaurant with 5 tables, their signature dish takes 10-15 minutes to make, they are awkward to eat during ""run-n-gun"" situations, you are planning to serve it at a tiny hovel with a ridiculously large outdoor eating area that (unless it's a mild day in Springtime/fall) is completely useless, and next to an embankment where the LIRR trains rush by every 7 minutes, kicking up dust and noise down below.  So yeah, welcome to the game of Forest Hills hot potato where you are eternally fighting for a table inside to eat your damned banana soup knots.  So yeah, how were they?  Quite good.  Decent skin, juicy interior, and with the usual ginger black vinegar, quite decent - assuming that you won the game of tables to snatch a place to eat.  It's everything else that's kinda ""meh"".  Their stir-fried rice cakes 雪菜炒年糕 contains edamame, shitake mushrooms, bamboo shoots and cured chinese mustard greens, and are considered a Shanghaiese staple dish.  When it comes to cooking rice cakes, it's difficult to stir fry them without going soft and sticking on the cooking surface.  The secret is to keep the heat high with a thin layer of oil on a non-stick surface, and to keep it stirring - preferably while a flavorful, slightly runny meat and veggie stir-fry is on the other pan, then combine before service.  The problem with Memories of Shanghai is that they got the hot oily part down by a massive overdose of hot oil, but then also went heavy on the sauce. All you taste is the greasiness and a massive hit of MSG, and you  taste it long after you leave the restaurant.  According to the missus, their wonton soup (上海餛飩) is kinda flavorless (and I agree) - and their chive dumplings 韭菜盒子 tastes only of oiliness and not much else.  So yeah, if I really have a hankering for banana soup knots...eh, fuck it.  I'll get Tibetan momos (since it's one express stop down in Jackson Heights), or I'll take the Q44SBS to Queensborough hill or Downtown Flushing for the joints there.  At least I can get other decent Shanghaiese dishes."

It seemed like a lot of people were ordering takeout because there was no place to sit. My friend and I arrived around 12:15 and ponied up to the bar.

There are only 3 small tables and a counter. It's located off of Austin St further back.Food wise, the soup dumplings are legit and were tasty. I wouldn't say they are the best I've ever had but it's really good for not being in Flushing or Chinatown. One thing I really loved were the spicy wontons with peanut sauce. I've never had them with the peanut sauce before and it added a great flavor."

The soup dumplings were good before but now they're insanely amazing. My issue with this place now is consistency. Some days they deliver some days they don't. But what really got me was yesterday I called to see if they were doing delivery. They were. After placing my order, I was told that for delivery orders they only take cash. That makes 0 sense to me. I asked why and the woman said ""just because""I don't understand this. If you take cards why wouldn't you take cards for delivery unless you're trying to limit your delivery services by saying this so less people ask for delivery. It's really odd to me since the two previous deliveries I had from them I paid by card"

I was told that the chef is from NanXing in Flushing so I had high expectations. The Xiao Long baos were pretty good but not the best I've ever had. The skin was a little thick but the meat was flavorful. The scallion pancakes were passable, not as crispy as I would have liked. The pan fried dumpling's skin was soft and doughy. The beef soup noodle didn't have a lot of beef and the noodles were mushy. Nothing was terrible and the price was right. But the food is slightly disappointing.

I was craving soup so we ordered the Beef Vermicelli soup, Wonton soup, and scallion pancakes. Hardly tasting the menu at all, but the soups were very good.  My only complaint about the soup would be that they were a bit heavy handed with the seaweed in the wonton soup. The scallion pancakes were some of the best I have eaten, and believe me, I am a huge scallion pancake fan. Excited to try the soup dumplings as those are next on my list."

The outside is crispy and it had just enough hoisin sauce.The steamed chicken dumplings (curry with minced onion) has such a unique flavor. We also tried the Sticky Rice ShaoMai, which I didn't like the texture of it. BYOSDS: Bring your own soup dumpling spoons! They provide small plastic ones but the soup from the dumpling doesn't fit. The soup dumplings (pork and crab) were good, but I didn't enjoy seeing the fat in the soup.Oh and the seafood and vegetable pan fried noodles lacked seafood and veggies.

I miss tokyo teriyaki. But this place is a solid replacement. I wish the menu were a little more expansive and they had a solid dinner dish that I could always go to. Instead I settle for one order of soup dumplings and some scallion pancakes which is pretty close to a meal. I hope one day they expand a little to something more hearty. In any case the people working there are lovely and always very courteous. I'll be a frequent customer for the forseeable future.

Two tables plus a few counters available inside, but their is extra seating outside in the alleyway by the door. I am fairly inexperienced with this kind of food, but the steamed chicken dumplings were incredibly good, by far the best I've ever had to this point. My girlfriend and I ate a good sized meal for 20 bucks including drinks, so it doesn't seem to break the bank either.

The curried beef soup had a good flavor... very fresh tasting with lots of cilantro. I added hot oil to it to give it a kick of spice which made it even better. The dumpling were the best. If were to return I would order more of the dumplings. For dessert I ordered the hot soy milk and a few pastries. I wouldn't recommend the pastries I suggest getting dessert elsewhere."

You know why? Because they have on 10 places to sit. Four at the counter and maybe a tight six at two tables.

The soup dumplings are perfect - thin skin, with just the right amount of meat, and flavorful broth. I love their piping hot sweet tofu pudding, although when I first went there, they didn't have the syrup and just served it with sugar crystals. They have salty tofu pudding as well.

We had heard so much about this place but the food did not hold up. Soup dumplings much better at Joe's Shanghai. Scallion pancakes also not up to par. The noodle dish was also very average. Probably won't go back with seats at a premium anyway.

What makes their soup dumpling top notch is the clean and rich broth inside. Other highly recommend items: their shrimp dumplings, chive pancakes, and fried dumplings.

I gave it 5 stars even though there is minimal seating space but the prices and the friendly staff more than made up for having to wait a few minutes.  Enjoy!

The dumpling aren't the worst I've ever tasted and it's definitely enough to satisfy the dumpling craving without going to Flushing. I got 1 order each of the pork dumplings and soup dumplings.Both types of dumpling were too doughy for my tastes. The pork in the  pork dumpling was succulent and juicy. While the soup in the soup dumpling was rather fatty and thick and the meat inside was super mushy (not a fan). The soup they give for service (I assume is the beef noodle soup?) was gelatinous and sour tasting. I had to throw it away immediately. With just the dumplings alone though, I could not finish them and was super full. Service was super slow too. I had to wait around 40 minutes to get my two orders. This place is not that bad, but it's not good either. No other places that serve dumplings in the nearby forest hills area has anything better or fresher than Memories of Shanghai. And it's definitely better than the sushi restaurant it replaced."

Loved the soup dumplings and other dumplings as well. I'm just worried once winter hits and there is no seating. While this can definitely be a take out place - soup dumplings don't travel well. Staff is clearly new but very sweet. I'm excited for this restaurant and I hope it does well!

I like their Shanghai Steam Soup Dumpling, it's is very juicy with very thin wraps. The Sweet Tofu Pudding has very fine texture and not too sweet. If you are like me, don't like very sweet dessert, this is perfect for you. I am a bit disappointed about their Beef Soup Noodle, its a bit bland. The Pork & Veggie Wonton Soup is good. Soup base has seaweed in it which I love.But this place is really too small, you should not go with a group. A few tables outside is good for summer eat-out but it's too cold to eat outside in winter. Whatever food I eat, I never like take out because food will not taste the same if you take it to go. I waited a while to get seats at the bar and saw a lot of people take theirs to go.I'll give 4 stars because this place is just way too small. However I will still go back and try other dishes.​"

When I went there were about six people, all busy at their tasks to make this machine operate. Go straight to the counter and place your order. Service was fast and polite. The Xiao Long Bao were my favorite! The skin was thick enough to prevent breaking while transferring to your spoon and the broth was clean and flavorful. We also had Pork Wonton in Chili Sauce (with a peanut sauce on top), Sticky Rice ShaoMai (with mushroom) and Pan Fried Pork Buns. Oh, while it's not on the menu, the have hot and sour soup.

Great soup dumplings and pan fried pork dumplings. The pork dumplings had just enough chew to them. Delicious!  I also ordered the seafood pan fried noodle which were tasty and had tiny bits of black mushroom, bay scallops, tiny shrimps, bamboo shoots, peapods and baby calamari. I wish they would up it a notch and have large pieces of seafood and charge more. They have the flavors down but not making it restaurant quality. We also had spring rolls and they were good, but a bit greasy. I'm looking forward to trying some other items from the menu like the beef vermicelli soup and pan fried pork buns. It's a really tiny place hidden down an alley, but super clean and has inside and outdoor seating. They have only been open one month and will deliver in the future. I'm a fan so far!"

We waited a little longer than I cared to as the lady was dealing with a phone/ delivery order gone awry. We placed our order after she sorted that out and waited only a little while longer for our food. We ordered baby wontons that turned out to be bigger than expected. The skin was also thicker than is traditional but it tasted like my childhood. We also got soup dumplings, also thicker skinned than is traditional but the taste is there. Husband also got the beef noodle soup which he ordered spicy (which was a mistake) and a hot and sour soup that he praised highly. Last thing we ordered is the turnip pastry which is better than some other places we've had (also larger in size). The price is cheap but not dirt cheap. They may be located in an obscure corner of my parents' neighborhood but they get swamped with delivery orders. Make sure to go slightly before the dinner rush otherwise you might have to wait. The taste might not be as authentic as my parents remember their childhood to be but it certainly hit the spot and taste good enough to me, even if the skin of both the baby wontons and the soup dumplings is too thick. We'll be back to visit next week when we visit my parents again!"

Soup dumplings taste great. Pancakes are good. Been here couple of times and tried a number of dishes there and really liked it a lot. The half star deduction is for the thick dumpling skin- I like it thin. This is one of my fav in Forest Hills area. To other reviewers- I don't recommend delivery because fresh hot dumplings won't taste as good esp. soup dumplings and if there is something missing..most likely it's because delivery guy took it. I heard a few customers never got their delivery at other restaurants- prob delivery guy ate it.

I simply thought: people in FH have very low standards for Chinese food. When I was told to try Memories, I kept putting it off. I finally went by for a sitdown meal on a Sunday afternoon. It was cold and rainy, and lots of people came in expecting to eat in but realized there were no tables/seats left and were forced to order takeout or abandon mission. I was arrived early enough to grab a table for three. I'm pescatarian, so I was limited quite a lot considering there's a lot of pork in Shanghainese food. I ordered the chive pancakes, because they sounded the most similar to chive/egg fried buns that I usually get at other Shanghainese places. It turns out the chive pancakes are essentially the buns I'm used to, except flattened. They are more like a stuffed flat bread, not like a scallion pancake. They arrived hot and crunchy, and tasted great, but I imagine they would get soggy and chewy if ordered as takeout or delivery. I also got the fried rice cakes with pickled cabbage, which is my usual fried rice cake dish. This one tasted great - lots of flavor, edamame and cabbage, unlike the Bund's version, which was bland and was mostly fried cake, few veggies. This one tastes even better with the chili oil on the tabletops. My friends ordered the regular pork soup dumplings and the crab soup dumplings, as well as the pan fried dumplings and the chili wontons. They liked all of their food, but especially liked the soup dumplings (both kinds). I am really pleased there is a LEGIT Shanghainese place in FH, and I sincerely hope they expand seating (or at least get a canopy for the outdoor area, as Tokyo Teriyaki previously had) and work out their kitchen kinks. During my visit, they gave my friends two regular soup dumplings instead of what they ordered, and when this was brought to their attention, we watched as the family working the kitchen then blamed each other for the mistake. They ended up giving my friends the crab soup dumplings they ordered, so my friends got two orders of regular soup dumplings as well as the crab one. It seems like they have a lot of staff helping but not efficiently."

Memories of Shanghai (MOS) has only been open for 4 months as of Jan 2019 and is off to a good start. Xueling Zhang's family made some smart choices.First, the location is on the less developed western end of Forest Hill's Austin Street in a little alley next to the NYPD's 112th Precinct, meaning the real estate is likely affordable.Second, they are starting small. The entire restaurant might charitably seat 12 people in the couple of tables and wall bar. There is almost as much kitchen as there is seating. There appears to be outdoor seating, so accommodations will be better in the warmer months.Third, they have a relatively limited menu considering the wide variety of possible Shanghainese dishes. Initially specializing in dumplings is logical from both a dine-in & take-out/delivery perspective.Choosing the soup dumplings (6) and pan fried pork buns (4) as a litmus test for the talents of the chef, revealed nuanced choices of ingredients & excellent execution of these Shanghai classics.In soup dumplings or XLB, three parts must be balanced together: the wrap, the fill & the juice. Each soup dumpling forms it's own little pressure cooker as they steam away in the paper lined bamboo container; too much wrap means less juice, too little wrap or too much meat means a soggy mess, the wrong balance of meat to filler means less flavor, etc.  MOS served perfectly formed soup dumplings that held together when lifted from the steamer; they got the critical  balance right. The meat mix of pork and aspic was acceptable & yielded a rich and flavorful soup. There did not appear to be any vegetable filler/binder. The wrap didn't absorb too much juice (freshly served of course) and had a pleasant firm chewiness. Best XLB ever? Well no, but certainly flavorful, exceptionally well executed & worth the price.The pan fried pork buns were a tad on the oily side, but were also well made and flavorful. This bun appears to start with a similar pork filling as the soup dumpling but wrapped in a rising (ie yeast based) dough bun that is reminiscent of steamed roast pork bbq buns.  The cooking technique for this style bun seems 2-fold. They are first steamed to cook the pork and raise the dough, then fried until the bottom is golden brown.  This combination yields a crunchy first bite with the softness of the raised dough and savory meat filling (where some of the juice has absorbed into the soft dough). The sensation was like a toasted bagel with the crunchy exterior & soft, chewy interior.MOS is a good choice for a quick bite to eat & I look forward to trying some more of their dishes in the future! Based on the smart choices they've made so far, I'm predicting long term success if they keep executing their food at this level."

Finally!! A good Chinese restaurant in Forest Hills! There has been a dearth of good Chinese food ever since Mama Liang's closed. This is a small spot and the menu is limited but what is available is great! Today we tried the Shanghai soup dumplings, soup dumplings with crab, beef noodle soup, pan fried noodles, scallion pancakes, and fried rice cakes with pickled vegetables.  The pan fried noodles were supposed to come with seafood but when the chef heard me say my daughter likes beef, he was able to accommodate! And when I said the beef noodle soup was for my son, he toned down the spiciness. The soup dumplings were juicy and not greasy. The noodles were crispy and the gravy was flavorful. The beef that came with the noodle soup was tender and not difficult to chew like other places. Scallion pancakes were crispy and not greasy. We're so happy this is here.

That's this Chive pancakes - my least favorite but still good flavor Tofu with sweet ginger sauce - not a lot of gingery taste but could be because it was the bottom of their last batch Total: $35 !!Can't wait to come back and try more!

There's about 6 table seating and 4 countertop as well as two outdoor tables. No free water unfortunately. Decently priced for the quantity and this area I suppose."

This place, in cold weather,  has about four counter seats and two tables.  Its tiny.  In warmer weather there is outdoor seating.  But they do offer take-out,  so that is a sure thing.  We opted for dumplings,  but the menu does offer more.  Based on the quality of the dumplings,  we will be back for more dumplings,  and to see what else is as good!  We tried the soup dumplings,  and shanghai sticky rice shoamai.  The soup dumplings were top quality,  but the sticky rice shoamai was not only a unique item, it was delicious!  There are only four in an order,  so I am going to get two orders next time.  We also got the bok choi and Shitake Mushrooms.  I am not the biggest fan of shitake mushrooms as I find their flavor way too dominant if the chef is not skilled.  This vegetable stir fry was very well done,  with a nice balance between the garlic and shitake.  I will certainly get that again."

A diverse selection of classic Shanghai dishes, reasonable prices, and friendly service! I had ordered a set of dishes to go, and ordered another set to sit down and eat with my friend.

Everything was very authentic. The beef scallion pancakes were one of the best I've ever had, flaky, crunchy, and not too oily. The soup dumplings are very good and like the ones you'd find in Chinatown or Flushing. The fried rice cakes were very yummy and wonderfully chewy and tasty. Chive pancakes were also delicious but are more of a giant dumpling than a pancake. All of the aforementioned are definitely worth repeating...and repeating! The beef noodle soup was the ugly duckling of this wonderful meal, although the beef was perfectly tender. A must try in the area!!!"

More like NIGHTMARES of Shanghai!!!  This has to be the worst business run in Forest Hills, Rego Park or Queens in general!!! Placed an order and surprised to find out they deliver, which sounded great but I should've guessed it was too good to be true.  Half an hour went by, an hour then two hours!!! I called over 10 times only to get an automated message from TWC stating their mailbox was full and no way to get any updates on my order.  Of course as I was getting ready to go to the restaurant to give them something to think about, my door bell rings!  These !?$&@! sent a guy that doesn't understand a word I said and expects me to pay for this meal!  Granted it's not his fault but he couldn't even call the restaurant for me to speak to them as he didn't have a clue as to what I was saying.  Extremely frustrating and livid that there is a business as such in my neighborhood.  I'd give them negative stars if Yelp allows it! I won't ever consider this place again and I hope you don't either!!!!!!!!!"

It was delicious. We got 1 pound of shrimp and one pound of snow crab legs in the mild garlic butter sauce. When we have ate at this restaurant before we ordered spicy sauces, but we wanted our 5 year old to try it so we chose the mild garlic butter. The garlic butter was actually delicious. It was a real sauce with a black pepper kick. On the side we had garlic bread and fries. Because of Covid we could order a margarita which was nice and strong. Everything was great. My wife liked the crab legs and I preferred the shrimp. They are head on with a ton of flavor. The food wasn't hot but I knew that would happen. It was warm. I would suggest this if you have a craving for it. 5 stars."

Some places don't take this into consideration and you end up regretting it later  At Oceanic Boil you really get a huge portion of food for your money. I always leave with leftovers that are still great tasting the following day. The wait staff are very attentive and anticipate your needs in a timely fashion. It gets really crowded, with a wait to be seated at times but the food generally arrives quickly."

The thing I'd recommend most is the lobster roll. Not to sound pretentious (but I know will come across that way anyway) but I lived in Boston for almost four years and let's say if you're a Bostonian, or any New Englander by the ocean, you'd find the lobster roll here to be lacking. But beyond those spoiled by living in that premiere lobster roll region of this country, most people will enjoy Oceanic Boil's take on it!Sadly, one of my favorite dishes in general, the crab cake, was 'eh'. It was pretty dried out and had some shell in it. All in all, a solid pick for seafood and I'm glad they're open for business!"

I have always eaten in the restaurant so I can not say how the delivery is. Staff was always very nice and attentive to our needs especially when it came to drinks and refills which is important to me. I always try to get my wife to eat here when I can, but because of the price we have to save this place for special occasions primarily. I always enjoy coming here for boil."

One thing about this type of meal? It's truly best to eat it in the restaurant but I couldn't take the craving much longer!!I got the Oceanic Boil combo with the spicy garlic old bay seasoning with one pound of snow crab legs , shrimp and I added sausages. It was very very good but the only con was that the shrimp were not peeled or cleaned so you will get this with a head and it's poop ; once I noticed I could not eat it but the flavor and serving size were very good. Moral of the story is come here but maybe 86 the shrimp Cajun Mac and cheese was pretty good as well. I would go back to sit in for snow crab legs and you can buy the seafood cracker for $6"

So we rushed with ordering our fOod.. and here is my  verdict with the food. Taste was about 3 stars-- the one in flushing is way better. The potatoes that coles with the shrimp was way over cooked, almost to the point of being  mashed potatoes.The shrimp, which was supposed th be the highlight of the show was over cooked thus making it hard to peel bEcuase the skin is now sticking to the meat.. The crawfish ( which my friends ordered) had a funky smell to it, that is why they didn't even touch it at all..The crab legs (according to my wife) was pretty good and well flavored.In the middle of our meal, I oRdered 1 soda for my wife.. and it took so long  that I actually forgot about it  already. The place is a starting to get some reviews and check ins but I believe that there is still a lot of room foR improvement. Training  the staff to be a little bit more attentive to the tables upon meal service will definitely go a long way, Maybe have a better consistency on how well or done the shrimp are. The garlic butter  -Lemon pEpper( I think that's the flavor) was pretty good. This for this one I give it 3 stars..So overall is 2 STARSSERVICE   is 2 STARStaste is 3 starsFOOD quality is 2 STARS ( due to the shrimp being over cooked)"

A bit of a drive, but closer than some of my favorite spots near my office and looking for something closer to home. We had a massive order, including margaritas to go, and were very happy with our order. We must have missed the online option for spice (we like spicy), so it ended up being more mild than we normally would order. The seafood was fresh enough, though the crab legs left a little to be desired. Will definitely keep in mind for future orders! Also, not entirely contactless.

However, I don't think I'll be going or ordering again. Their sizes seem smaller than other places I've gone to. This was one pound shrimp that comes with corn and potatoes for 17$. They must have measured it with the potatoes because there were 3 huge pieces. That weighed down most of the bag. The sauce was barely there and wasn't as garlicy or spicy as other places I've tried in the past. They also charge 3$ for extra sauce which is pretty steep for a tiny container. The delivery was pretty quick but I didn't get that satisfaction one gets after a good seafood boil."

The location is not too big, but it's very cozy and has great atmosphere.I've tried the BBQ Shrimp basket appetizer which comes with super crispy cajun fries which are both amazing. Also another great appetizer choice is the Calamari with the spicy mayo. I'm not a fan of gummy and mushy calamari this was nice and crispy.The drinks are pretty strong and delicious as well. I am huge fan of a frozen margaritas and the one served here won't get any negative comments from me. Also try the passion fruit cocktail, it packs a strong kick. Out of the mains, I always ordered the combo with a pound of snow crab legs and a pound of shrimp in a mild garlic butter sauce. It still has a little kick to it and It doesn't kill the taste by overpowering it with more heat. By the way this was always shared between two people. Portions are fairly big especially if you have an appetizer prior. The quality of the food is just top notch, the meat in the legs just slides out and shrimp even though you have to put some work into in ( LOL ) it's worth the troubles. Be prepared to get a little messy and work for your food but you won't be disappointed. The sauce is so good you'll keep on dipping whatever you worked for, but you can always order some BBQ sauce on the side for a dip you won't regret. You'll get gloves and a bib with a secret compartment for whatever falls off the table.... This place is so good I plan on going back very soon."

Every server I've had and even the bartender at the back bar are always so helpful with suggestions on food and drinks. Tips: - The appetizers come with a side of Cajun fries (the fries are perfection) -  1 combo platter is enough for 2 people. - The calamari appetizer is decent. It comes with fries as I mentioned above so if you order the calamari you may get too full before your meal comes out. - I'm on the edge about the chicken wings appetizer. The first time I ordered them they were delicious and the second time I ordered them they were very crispy as we asked for but did not have much flavor. I had to use lots of hot sauce on them. - The combo platters come with corn and potatoes. The corn and potatoes are soaked in whatever sauce you ordered the seafood in. *This was not an issue for me but other people may not care for this. - I suggest trying the snow crab legs - Try the spicy garlic butter sauce. The spice level is mild. My favorite. I know I'll be back and maybe I'll try the fried lobster next time."

Took a while for a server/host to flag us down but everything went down like this:Service: we had a male server, didn't catch his name, but he was very attentive to our table without overly hovering over us and interrupting our dinner. I can see him glancing over here and there to see if we had enough water, etc. He also explained the menu to us and recommended certain things to our liking. I ended up ordering everything he recommended plus more cause i'm just fat.Food: Absolutely amazing. Taste was great, display was nice, nothing too heavy and everything was flavorful. We paid 119$ for an order of chicken finger baskets, branzino, whole lobster + crawfish combo, extra new zealand mussels, virgin pina colada, and margarita on the rocks. I wish the place was a bit bigger and the seats weren't stationed to the floor. However it didn't really both us much.Ambiance: They had pop/modern songs playing throughout my stay. It was on at a comfortable volume so that I didn't have to speak up while conversing with the fam. Place was dimly lit, but the outdoor sunsetting light complimented very well and made the atmosphere great for an early dinner."

I would order that alone with an extra side of rice and call it a day if I were solo. The bbq shrimp basket came with 6-8 big shrimps dressed and fired up in delicious bbq sauce, head-on... side of Cajun fries that were not quite enough and sauce and bitty ramekin of corn that was more decor.The mussels were a bit overdone but large and doused in a delish garlic butter (we chose the house ""oceanic mix"" of old bay, spicy and garlic) that was basically a tapenade slurry with melted butter- yum. The shrimp bag was better as the shrimp head juices sucked in the garlic oil and the structure just innately made it a wonderful natural coil for flavor. My margarita was strong just the way I like it with a twist- none other than my fave liquor- st germain. Her lycheetini was even more potent and had a soft kick with the fruit purée and his mango daiquiri just looked amazing.What a wonderful intro and welcomed boil to the neighborhood. Clearly this is not a little known fact since your party had to be all present before seating and after an hour or so they did kick us out for chatting because there were ppl waiting for a table. Not kick, sorry- suggested. They are great actually. If you are not from here, that may sound a bit crass but every native knows time waits for no one here in nyc."

We came here for my fiancé's birthday and ordered a large selection of items including shrimp, crab Legs and crawfish tossed with the spicy garlic sauce. The sauce was cooked to perfection and seriously some of the most delicious eats I have had in NYC. For the quality and quantity of seafood we were served the prices were very affordable and our group of three were very full and satisfied. Pro tip: come with a group so you can mix and match a variety of seafood and sauces. The space was small and seating is rather limited however we got a table pretty quickly as soon as we walked in.

The calamari and soft shelled crab were crunchy and good. It came with a spicy mayo sauce which was yummy and a side of fries which were tasty as well. The corn that came with it wasn't very good- it could have done without the corn.The lobster and king crab legs were full of meat and  so I would definitely recommend these. The shrimp was ok - they were kind of on the smaller side compared to other boil places I've been to. The oceanic sauce that came with it was subpar. It lacked real full flavor. The sauce could've been made slightly saltier and it really wasn't that memorable. I was disappointed by the oceanic boil sauce. I didn't try the other sauces though. Overall, I've had better seafood boils at other restaurants. Everything is in the sauce and the oceanic boil sauce was lacking. Other than that, the appetizers and sides were good and service is good too."

How hard is using Zatarain's? How is it even possible to make a crab and shrimp boil with no flavor? Like zero! Now let's be clear: the sauce is yummy, the spicy fries are tasty and crispy, the many dips are also quite good. But the meat itself: no flavor to be found. The crab had a hint, just a rumor, a suspicion of flavor- like they'd passed by a sign advertising crab boil. I've spent a good deal of time in Louisiana enjoying proper crab boil. This is like pizza made outside NY- it may look like sauce, might look like cheese, but one bite and you know you've made a mistake. It's not awful, but not worth another trip."

Their stone crab, little neck clam and shrimps are my all time favorite. Their clams are bigger and fresher than any places that I've ever been to. That includes The Boil, Claw Daddy and Naked Crab. Their Garlic butter sauce and Oceanic boil sauce are better than all the competitors. Me and my family always lick the sauce off the plastic bags, it is just that good. Their prices are fairly reasonable too. I used to order their combos thinking it would save me money. It actually doesn't. It only saves you $1. So if you want different sauce for each boil, I say go for their non-combo boils. I knocked off 1 star for their service because they messed up my take out order once. They forgot to give us the shrimp that we ordered, so we had to drive 20 minutes to get that back. Also two days ago I ordered take out due to Covid from Yelp. It says the ordered was accepted and will be ready in an hour. So we drove there and turned out it was closed. Again for the second time I drove there 40 minutes round trip for nothing. As a small business during this crisis, you guys should really improve your service. It is one thing to mess up the order once in a while. But this is 2 times out of 5 which is almost 50% of the time.  If they keep this up, they are losing me as their customer forever."

WHAT WE GOT: We got the 1 lb. shrimp and 1 lb. crawfish combo, which comes with a piece of corn and a couple chunks of potato. We also got an order of French fries which were delicious!(!) HOW IT DID: I'm happy to say that, in contrast to other boil places we've been to, our palates felt significantly less salty. The Oceanic Boil house sauce (a mix of all their sauces: garlic butter, cajun spices, and lemon pepper) also tasted a little sweeter than other boils. It seemed like there was a slight sweetness to it, which sets it apart! And of course, the quality of the shrimp and crawfish was up there. Everything was meaty and easy to peel.(!) HOW IT DID, PT 2: I would be remiss to not talk about how the food is actually served. Our server tossed the bag around a bit to mix the sauce up, and -- I really appreciate this -- it was all served in a bowl. It's actually easier to navigate vs. fishing your hand into a sauced up bag.(!) SPECIAL MENTION: The sauce that came with the fries were delightfully different: it was an orange sauce, think thousand island with hints of spice or tabasco. It worked really well with the fries!(!) SERVICE & VIBES: Excellent service, and we felt like we were taken care of. It's not a big restaurant so it has a nice, less hectic vibe to it. Special mention to those interesting chair backs that they have as well haha."

The mussels were ok & they had cheese on top, which was weird, but I like cheese & love mussels...so it wasn't bad, but just a weird combination. The oysters were fine too. For our boil I had mussels with crab legs in the oceanic sauce which was a combination of sweet & spicy but balanced well. My friend had crab legs with shrimp with the spicy garlic butter. Both came with corn & potatoes. I wish it would've came with sausage as well as been a little more saucy. The seafood was coated good in the sauce, however it wasn't enough in my bag to dip my seafood in the sauce. For drinks  I had a lychee-Tini which was fine & my friend had a margarita, which was also fine.My friend did mention the seats aren't really comfortable, which it's nailed to ground & it's like a piece of metal you're sitting on with a bar for your back.

I visited with my family for an early Sunday dinner. On the entire drive over, my sisters were convinced we wouldn't be seated immediately and would instead have to wait for nearly an hour. The restaurant has a Yelp Waitlist that I checked every five minutes and never had to use because the wait time was less than one minute each time I checked. Parking was terrible - but that's not news to anyone who is familiar with this area of Queens. We did get lucky however and found street parking a few blocks away from the restaurant. We were seated immediately and must have missed the rush my sisters were warning me about because about 20 minutes after we were seated people started to rush in. We waited a while before being greeted by our waiter, which gave us the opportunity to put in our food orders in while he took our drink orders. I ordered a virgin pina colada - which was a bit watery. I also ordered the oceanic combo which came with snow crab legs, head-on shrimp, corn and potatoes in the oceanic sauce (a thick, spicy garlic based sauce). It was good, but a bit slimy, which explains the latex gloves and bib they give you prior to bringing you your order."

By the time everyone else had gotten their food, mine was cold but I was hungry so I didn't make a fuss. - The lobster roll comes on a toasted 6in roll, the meat is cold ( for those who likes it heated ) - The Cajun fries are deliciousssss- The Coconut shrimp looked gigantic but it had a very thick breading and a small piece of shrimp inside. They were good but very deceiving in size- The Catfish slider was amazinggggg- Chicken fingers were average nothing special- The snow crab legs comes with corn and potatoes. They give 1lb of legs which is pretty satisfying. They have different sauce options, the garlic butter covered snow crab legs were 10/10Overall, Our waiter was polite and the service was good given the restaurant was full. The food was delicious.

I found this place on Yelp and we decided to give it a try.We ordered: lobster bisque, 1lb of mussels in oceanic sauce (house recommended), 2lbs of clams in garlic butter lemon pepper, 1lb king crab, 1lb shrimp and a lobster roll.The lobster bisque was interesting. It sort of tasted like a mix of lobster bisque and tomato soup. It was weird and interesting but decent. Definitely not your standard lobster bisque. The mussels were tasty and the oceanic sauce made it even better. (It's the recommended sauce for a reason and I recommend you try it). The clams were cooked perfectly, the 1lb king crab leg turned out to be just one huge leg but it was juicy nonetheless and the shrimp was fresh, perfectly medium firm and succulent. The mains come in a bag with corn and potato. I didn't try the lobster roll because the waitress forgot it and it came out late. By this time, I was already pretty full. They also forgot our ginger ale.We originally wanted crawfish but we learned today that crawfish season is April. If you order crawfish now, it's most likely frozen. Bummer. We also ordered green tea crepe with a side of vanilla ice cream. The crepe was a disappointment. It was so frozen that we couldn't even cut through it with utensils. My chardonnay was also a disappointment too. Very cheap quality and too sweet (IMO).Service: 4/5Our waitress was very sweet and accommodating. Cute girl from Thailand. Very attentive minus the forgotten lobster roll and ginger ale but her effort was endearing. Ambiance: 2/5The interior of this place is nothing special. It looks a bit plain.

I got the garlic butter sauce and it was nice and creamy! It got super messy but that's expected. The shrimp came with the heads on and the shell was very thin so it was hard to peel. So hard that I couldn't finish eating them! The strawberry daiquiri was good, although it was thick so I'm thinking it may have been mixed with jello.

She garlic butter was a 4 on a scale from 1-10. The whole time I'm eating their crab legs I'm wishing it was Oceanic Boils crab legs. Oceanic Boil is definitely worth 5 stars in book."

You must try the gumbo definitely is one of the best I have had. The Cajun Mac and cheese taste delicious. For the main course I had snow crab legs w shrimp in butter garlic sauce. Let's just say I must have this again. My boyfriend had the Cajun catfish. He really enjoyed it. I highly recommend this place

The first time was a lot better experience. The service was extremely slow tonight. I was very surprised. It was just my daughter and I and we ordered 2lbs of shrimp, crab legs and 1 lobster. I knew I was going to bring the rest home to my husband and in-laws. I have zero idea how to crack this stuff properly. I don't know what is edible and what isn't. I just put it in my mouth.. if it tastes decent, then it stays. I had to crack everything open before I left because I knew we didn't have a cracker thing at home. The waiter offered zero help in that department. I asked for a little thing to get the crab meat out of the legs...and I was handed a wooden pic. I snapped it in half on accident. I cut my knuckles on... I have no idea. My husband and his toolshed friends went there about a year ago and the guy cracked everything for them. I watched everyone around me get their food, even though they came in after me. Normally I wouldn't think much of it.. because different things come out at different times. Buttttttttt....the women next to me that came in about 10 mins after I did, was chowing down on crab legs and shrimp. Soooo we pretty much ordered the same thing but she got hers first. The waiter kept apologizing and said 2 more minutes, 2 more minutes. It wasn't until I got up to leave, after an hour of waiting that my food was brought out. He kept saying that they were changing the broth. But...the table next to me had their seafood. This place is good to come with a family.. it wasn't great doing all the work alone. I left this place hungry. $100+ with tip and I ended up walking to the bakery down the block and ate a brownie on my way home."

They advertise opening at noon; but don't expect to be let in immediately. Typical bar atmosphere; music currently treading on radio and TVs tuned to ESPN. The only reason I'm not reviewing this place a one star is because of their wait staffs candidness. They were upfront about their crawfish being frozen (due to the season) and encouraged us to explore other options on their menu. Settled on New England Clam Chowder as an appetizer followed by a pound of shrimp and crab cake. The chowder was inconsistent. My bowl was very watery while my fiancé's was thick; loaded with potatoes and very little clam. They pair their chowder with baked garlic bread as opposed to tHe traditional packaged oyster crackers. Everything with the main entree was wrong. They accidentally made the shrimp spicy and entirely forgot about her crab cake. Seeing that the restaurant had just opened we expected the crab cake to take longer than everything else. But 10 minutes turned into 20 and when we finally asked the waitress to check in on her plate she completely blanked. There was no apology, just an offer to place the order now. Disappointed with this restaurant and their lack of attentiveness."

For a party of 5, I waited about 35 mins-40 mins, including a 29 minute wait just on the ""Yelp"" list. Once we were seated, the servers were really sweet and remained very attentive. I tried the lobster with Cajun seasoning. It came with 2 potatoes and corn, all shaked and smothered in the delicious sauce. The sauce had a kick, but the flavors still stood out. I had fun eating the lobster (which was of a good size) and though took longer to eat than others in the table who opted for smaller dishes, I thought it was worth it. The snow crabs I have previously tried from here with garlic sauce are also delectable. They definitely don't skimp on any sauce.Come and try out this restaurant- especially on a date if you are not afraid of eating good and getting dirty."

We're both big seafood fans so we're excited about this. If you live in the area or close enough by, i highly recommend it. The crab legs were my favorite. I do have a garlic intolerance, so I unfortunately couldn't have the seafood with the sauces they offer (all have a garlic butter base). Which was sad, but that's ok. I can't say we'll be back any time soon--just not quite worth the trek from the Bronx for us. But again, definitely plan a visit if you live nearby."

I love seafood and I used to go to Joe's Crab Shack for years but when I discovered Oceanic Boil, that was it. buh-bye JCS, hello new seafood spot.This last visit was so different from all out previous ones that I have to leave a review. We came at around 7 on a Saturday, it was busy but not too busy that we were able to get a seat immediately (there are 4 of us). BTW the place is small, but it does it's job.This review will NOT be about their food because their food is always exceptional. This will be about the service we've been subjected to here.So, as we were winding down our dinner with drinks and the green tea flan, I believe, we also were given the bill. Well, we decided to grab one more round of drinks to finish off the desert and one of the waitresses there stopped and told us ""IDK where your waiter is but I really need this table"". I was like ""did I hear her correctly?"" Did she reserve our table to a different group even before we were done eating and drinking? This seriously left a very sour taste in my mouth that not even the taste of their food can wash down...I was beyond disappointed. I've never been to a restaurant that did that. EVER.I know the restaurant is small and they are extremely busy but you don't lie to potential customers who are asking for how long the wait is and tell them it isn't long and then kick out your current customers since you told the potential ones its not a long wait.WHO DOES THAT?"

At the beginning my girlfriends and I had to wait for about 45 minutes (the wait is expected in the evening). We decided to wait by the bar until a table became available. We started off with a bad experience by the bar but I am so happy to see how that quickly changed thanks to the manager. They made sure our experience with the restaurant turned into a positive one again and it did. I will continue to go to Oceanic boil thanks to that service, it just makes the food even yummier.

I'm somewhere between a 3 and a 4, and if I think abt various aspects of the quality of food, drink, service, ambience, decor, etc, I'd grade them each very differently. We arrived around 8pm on a Thursday (a co-worker and I) after leaving a trade show. We were basically starving after having fasted all afternoon (and having been on our feet the whole time at the trade show). Parking sucks on these streets, so we circled for 5 - 10 min and were lucky to park outside. You might all yourself, ""WTF does this have to do with the restaurant?""  When rating any establishment, you're comparing them with others. If a restaurant with a parking lot gives you a more relaxing experience, then why shouldn't a lack of parking work against you? In this case, I don't detract even a whole point from them for the parking, and we were lucky to find sombre seating available at the bar when we arrived... would have preferred a table, but locals seem to love this place. I didn't catch the bartender's name, but he was a blast. Very funny and personable, great personality and accommodating. And damn... dude can sell you a bridge if he wants to. Upon placing the order with him, when I found out that they don't serve blue cheese dressing with the chicken wings, I told him to forget abt it and just bring me the lobster bisque. Even though he said out was spicy, and there's no blue cheese dressing, he somehow convinced me-- thru pure enthusiasm--to give the wings a try, AND the lobster bisque. Hard core.I got a Strawberry Daiquiri... my co-worker laughed ay me, but screw him. I have to say, though... it wasn't a good daiquiri... it wasn't actually sweet. It was blended ice with a slight strawberry flavor and tasted like rum. I guess I just like them sweet. When the Lobster Bisque came... both of us had ordered it... it was expensive and we were starving, so I was surprised to see that my co-worker had left over about 25% of the bowl of soup! But truthfully, as another reviewer mentioned, it's a very different Lobster Bisque than what you're likely accustomed to. I liked the flavor on that it was complex but still creamy, but it wasn't thick at all. I feel like I wish they had reduced it more... boil out more of the water content to thicken the consistency. To their credit, though, I'll bet there is more pieces of lobster on that soup than you've ever seen a Bisque have before. But the soup itself tasted exactly like the sauce in an excellent Penne a la Vodka, but not thick, and no penne. Once our Lobster and Shrimp had arrived, I realized that the bartender forgot abt the Chicken Wings he sold me on. It's ok... I want looking forward to them very much! While the Lobster and Shrimp were good, the Garlic Butter sauce it's in are very overpowering. I got it mild, and still, I couldn't really taste the meat itself. To me, that's a terrible shame. In that sense, I'm a traditionalist (and not a Creole traditionalist!)... I like my shellfish with minimal sauce, or none at all. The meal was very messy, but they give you a bib, nitrile rubber gloves (with which to 'operate' on the victim), crackers, and a pair of scissors. My co-worker was kind of disgusted that the shrimp were head-on... he sat there struggling to remove the head, the shell, and de-vein the things and I was dying laughing at the perturbed but determined look on his face. He didn't eat very much. But me? I'll eat dog or cat of you make it taste good enough! I finished it, but it wasn't something I'd get again. And there you have it. I don't believe it's a 5 star place, though I understand how someone could feel that way if they loved the style of food enough."

The girl behind the front desk at the hotel vouched for this joint so I knew that I would have a verified true local, neck tats and all, to blame if she was wrong about this which is always important to have when you travel in case of fauda.Truuu thugs got choices on spice level to make your snow crab legs either extra spicy or super spicy, on top of the spice level this banger is already supposed to have. Being the owner of a very unflattering t-shirt from beating the fire burger challenge at LBBB in Houston where I am a designated truuuu thug and spice hound to eat the burger, I like to call my stuff as spicy as you can go for this delicate little porcelain doll. So I ordered super spicy, the spiciest mamma mia, madonne, level you can get. In my Ron Swanson voice: I'm not sure you heard what I said. I want ALL of the spices.Charmingly they thought I was not #about #that #life and provided disposable plastic gloves with my order as if I did not know what I was doing and did not know my way around some spice, as if I must be new here. Meanwhile their hottest spice level on the crab was about as mild as eating a room temperature tomato. Given the gloves (the only other place I have been given that in all of my spicy life was at LBBB during the fire burger challenge) I had prepared my body for more.Absent the requisite spice level I thought I was getting since I had ordered super spicy, the snow crab legs were entirely divine with loads of garlic (to keep Dracula away) and so much better than I worried I might find this close to the airport, which is almost TOO close to the airport unless you are window shopping for bargain priced Thai ladyboys and motels that charge in six minute increments like law firms. And unlike other competitors of this type of seafood biz in the Jackson Heights area that only gave you the legs at a similar price point in the 20s, these kind gentlesirs threw in the corn and potatoes to boot making it an easy decision to dine with them for value and convenience.Definitely worth considering for a night near the LGA airport, just know that even the hottest spice level is not all that and a bag of chips. But still a very pleasant taste of the briny deep and satisfying gastronomic tour of the LGA adjacent neighborhood to know this is an option here in the 'hood as an alternative to the LGA Plaza hotel resto or the Little Caesars.Snow crab legs pair well with everything, but especially with Rick & Morty back in the hotel room."

I still like theBoil in the city much more (2 locations, but I like Waverly the best b/c it's much more spacious) when it comes to the all-magical make-or-break sauce, but this place is definitely easier to get to if you drive. In terms of freshness of seafood, it was fine, and the prices are slightly cheaper than theBoil, but the primary issue I had with this joint was that I was SO THIRSTY for hours after eating here. As I was eating the meal, I was thinking, ""Mm. This is pretty tasty! I'd go here again."" but then later that night, I was thinking, ""Danggg how much salt/MSG did they put in that sauce? I am so freaking thirsty!!"" All in all, it tasted good going in, but the ridiculous level of thirst I experienced afterwards would probably make it unlikely that I'd go again. That said, only 2 out of the 4 of us had the thirst issue, so maybe if you're not sensitive in that way, it won't be that big of a deal."

You can easily find the street parking. In queens area, I think this place serve a really good creole / cajun food. Their seafood is fresh and their drinks are very good. We tried their garlic butter sauce with the seafood in the past and it was good. We take on oceanic boil sauce today. This is their mixed sauce and it is spicy. We also try their garlic noodle and they taste way better than other places garlic noodle. The noodle is moist and full of flavor. Overall, this is one of our go to restaurant in queens.

Both times we sat at the bar because for me the tables are too close together for my liking. Music was nothing special seemed like it was music of opportunity and not an actual play list. First time I had the shrimp with potatoes and corn in mild lemon pepper and garlic sauce. To drink I have the peach lemonade. The second time I had crabs, potatoes and corn in mild garlic sauce with a side of old bay and no drink.The people I was with had French fries and fried catfish which was good.  I preferred the crab over the shrimp just cause it has a better natural flavor and the mild garlic sauce. The potatoes were a little under done, but the corn is amazing especially when dipping it in the sauce!! The drink was perfect, not too sweet, but had a punch to it.The staff was really nice, especially our bartender (I'm bad with names) Overall I'd come back!!"

The way it smelled when I walked in didn't compare to what the food tasted like. The spicy garlic & old bay sauce tasted funny, and the shrimp wasn't cleaned so my partner didn't eat any of it but it was still a great experience. I'm on a mission to try every seafood boil restaurant in the city. This has been the third spot I've been to. It didn't compare to Loui Loui in Harlem but the service was amazing and they definitely accommodated to my requests.I hope that they'll offer head off shrimp soon. The crab was insanely fresh with lots of meat. I would go back for just the crab. Some of the crawfish were really small, but I guess because it wasn't in season. The piña coladas are to die for!Crawfish were a bit tasteless. I like to crack the claws and eat the bit of meat in there but it didn't set my taste buds on fire. The garlic noodles were too spicy to eat, kind of threw off the flavors of everything else. I really wanted to love this place! Maybe next time."

Their drinks are also really tasty also.  On to why I leave a review today.This place tasted great for a while, but recent delivery had tons of sand in their boiled clams, so much so that you can see literal sand patches on the clams.  Not sure if they didn't rinse the clams long enough, but it was crunchy like cheetos, and believe me that's not a good thing for clams.  The snow crabs had gotten really salty and wasn't a good combination with their recommended sauce :( .  The shrimps were also soft and pasty when you peel off the shell, which told us they weren't that fresh, even for frozen shrimp.  I never had issues until today, I guess their quality has dropped since their open, which sucks because I really liked this restaurant."

Place was completely  full on a Tuesday night. We were a party of 7. For appetizers, we had my usual catfish Basket, one wanted to try the crab cake basket and one ordered Cajun fries. I love cat fish. Seriously it's so good. It's not a fish I'd buy to cook at home since I don't fry food, but these are always cooked perfectly. My only issue is the amount, I wish they'd sell an entree portion. I want a big piece of catfish! Everyone loved the fries and the fish. I didn't try the crab cake. For dinner, I shared 1 lb. of snow crabs and 1 lb. of mussels in garlic butter with L. There was 2 orders of the Oceanic Combo... That combo has lobster, shrimp, crawfish and snow crabs. D ordered a lb of snow crab and 1lb of crawfish I think.Everything was good. Seafood was fresh. Snow crab was very sweet. Mussels were plump. Shrimp was meaty. I tried a crawfish. Not my fav. So lil meat, mostly shells. They weren't in season but nobody at the table seemed to care cuz they loved everything! Lobster was great. It's not something I can eat often. I think I could've taken a lil home and add some carbs to soak some of that sauce.

Refilled our waters. Definitely recommend the snow crabs."

We got a tiny table for two right by the front window, which me and my friend didn't mind, since it was more private and away from the rest of the diners there. We decided to order the fried calamari as an appetizer and the sausage as a side. The calamari was delicious along with the fries it came with. Both were seasoned well and the spicy mayo we got with it was delish. The sausage came in a tiny cup, and although it was good, I don't think it was worth the $5.For our entree, we ordered the 1lb of snow crab legs and 1lb of shrimp with the garlic butter sauce. Both were absolutely phenomenal and we couldn't have been any more happier with our order.My only complaint is that it took a while for our entree to come out. 40 minutes to be exact, but the food made up for it. Will definitely be returning to this place."

I really look forward to going back and trying out many other items from their menu. The options we all so good it was kinda hard to choose. Great addition to Jackson Heights!!

The staff was courteous, kind and attentive the entire night. The music is also a plus! 90s R&B jams are always clutch. Drinks are well made and priced right. For sides, we ordered Cajun fries, white rice, and the catfish basket.

Not disappointed at all. Depending on the night, you may have to wait a while to sit down. I went on a Saturday night and had to wait about an hour. They do not take reservations on the weekends so be prepared. We waited at the bar for a little and had a drink and starter there before being moved to the table. They provide you with gloves and bib depending what you order. We got the snow crab legs and crawfish which came with a side of potatoes and corn. The recommended oceanic boil sauce was great, it says its spicy and for those who cannot tolerate spice you can ask for it mild (like me). Ot was packed but the staff was on point and the music gave out vibes playing tons of 90s music and plenty of r&b. Definitely a place  I will be returning to."

I called to make a reservation, but we were told they dont take reservations on Friday-Sunday. (Totally understandable). When we got there, we were greeted by the host and we had to wait 30mins. The place was pretty crowded. There wasnt much of a waiting area. The restaurant itself is pretty small. There is a bar area in the back where guests can grab a drink while waiting. Our food didnt take long to come at all. We got (2) orders of the Alaskan Crab & Shrimp. We got one with Old Bay/Butter & the other with the Oceanic Boil Sauce. Both sauces were absolutely DELICIOUS! We also ordered calamari with fries & garlic bread. The calamari was great. However the ""garlic bread"" was just a deli roll with garlic seasoning. (Wouldn't recommend it.) Our drinks were great, a little pricey for the size. Aside from the food, this restaurant has very good ambiance. I was little turned off when I went to the bathroom and saw high chairs stacked there. Very unhygienic. Also, the restuarant does not have parking. You'd have to find metered street parking, which can be a little difficult. Overall, I enjoyed it and we'll definitely be back!"

The fish was very tasty and well seasoned. My date and I licked the bones dry! The oysters were good, but we were missing the proper utensils (small fork). The clams were also tasty and my date enjoyed the potatoes and corn on the cob that accompanied the clams. The piña coladas were pretty darn good.

The food is very important but the hospitality begins first. Especially when you have a restaurant that is geared towards Cajun food. Southern hospitality, duh. I had to really flag down a person to refill my water. When you are running a boil restaurant, it's important to keep the water flowing. Even a pitcher of water on the table would have been ok. All that salt, and spice - H20 helps. When I finally received water, the waitress knocked over my cup and apologized. She didn't get a napkin or rag to even clean up the spill. This experience really raised my eyebrow. It's a boil place, it's messy, but I am still out to eat! To begin, they brought us the garlic noodles and Cajun Mac and cheese. I am so glad that I didn't get the lobster Mac and cheese. I felt like both noodles were edible. Nonetheless, it wasn't anything super special. I felt like I was eating from a box of KRAFT macaroni with seasoning added on top. Macaroni was way over cooked. The garlic noodles weren't spicy but had a lot of garlic on them. It was what you would envision with shrimp scampi. It wasn't impressive to me because I make a lot of spaghetti at home and add garlic and oil. We decided to opt for the shrimp boil 1lb. to share. We weren't in the mood for the fried food last night. We opted out for the crawfish. Let me say that I have been to Louisiana several times. I have had some good ol' Louisiana crawfish. During the month of January, they are not in season. This must mean that they get their crawfish from China or they are farm raised. I read a past review that they were tasteless. This is probably why. It doesn't feel like a true Cajun place. The boil garlic and old bay was very tasty. My potatoes were mostly not fully cooked throughout. Corn was exceptional. To be honest, I wasn't looking forward to the corn but I think the corn and shrimp were my favorite. The quality of the shrimp was fresh. Overall, the food here was ok. I am very grateful for the meal that I had with someone I love. ShrimpWas fresh."

So I naturally called them, not pissed off but kind of disappointed because I didnt get my full order. I basically wanted to point out that they missed something so they should continue to double check every delivery order. Humans make mistakes, I understood it and that was what I told them. They were so nice about it, they apologized and ask if I wanted to get credit for it, the next time I visit or get something delivered and I gladly accepted. A few minuted after I ate my food, the doorbell rang and the same delivery man came up and gave me the ""missing drink"". I was soo surprised by it. Needless to say, they did an awesome job!"

Let me tell you ! This was finger licking Good ! I wanted to slap someone .. JP LOL . The crab legs had a lot of meat , the shrimps were juicy and huge ( unpeeled) and the corn and potatoes were Juicyyyyy ! I couldn't move after I ate . I needed help to the cab smh .

Menu specializing in seafood with both large and small dishes.Wasn't overly hungry, but wanted to try a bit of everything. Decided on the  Seafood Gumbo ($8), Fish Taco ($10), and Sauteed Veggies ($4). Food comes in just under an hour - super hefty bag that comes with utensils and sauces. Veggies are a batch of steamed broccoli, potatoes and other greens with a glaze of butter on them (pretty good). Gumbo has a thick consistency but was overall lacking in some flavor and more meat. The pair of tacos envelop an overly fried fish with some veggies inside. Liked the soft tortilla but the meat needs work. Cajun fries are delicious with the side sauce.Overall the meal was okay - I think this is probably a better spot to go in person rather than for delivery."

We wanted seafood, and was hoping we could get it delivered via uber eats or seem less. We couldn't so we decided to go because we were impressed with the menu. The only thing I did not like was the long wait time. The food was so good... I had the shrimp, with snow crab legs potato, and corn.  The staff was very nice and attentive. Update: just found out you can order on Ubereats yaaaaa!!!"

This was my second time here. 1st Time was for my birthday in June and second time was recently in December with my boyfriend. He loved it and I loved it all over again. the ambience is very comfortable, you are greater as soon as you walk in. Both times the music was good, so you can do a little head bob and sing along while waiting for your food. Portion size are amazing. I am a seafood eater and love seafood especially boils. They give you gloves for those who don't want your hands to get dirty and a bib. The first time I ordered a drink it was pretty strong (just how I like it). Will definitely recommend anyone to go here, I actually already did. And I must say the price are pretty reasonable. For two boils with extra sides $78.00, I can't complain."

From the drinks to the food. They provide enough coverage for you to get eat without getting too messy. Great service as well. I've eaten there 2x and it has lived up to the reviews both times.

It is your typical Louisiana Boiled Seafood ran by Vietnamese folks. We got the Fired Lobster special, a combo of 1lb crawfish and shrimp and a side of garlic noodles. The fried lobster was ok nothing special. The combo though was preety darn good. It seemed like it was more then 2lbs of food. The Crawfish were big and seemed endless. The sauce we chose was the garlic butter lemon pepper. Boy oh boy was that sauce phenomenal. When I was finished I was scooping from the bottom of the bowl just eating the sauce. The garlic noodles are a must if you love garlic. Super delicious. This place is small and gets crowded. We arrived at 6pm and was seared right away but by 7pm people were waiting and when I walked past later on at 845pm there was huge crowd outside waiting and this was a Sunday night. Lastly the prices were reasonable for the amount of food you get."

Now I'm wishing there were more stars to give this place. A couple weeks ago I had a dinner in Long Beach California that was five times as expensive not a fraction is good is this. This is simply the most amazing Cajun seafood place I have ever encountered in my life and I've been to New Orleans more than once. We got the super duper seafood boil with lobster crab crayfish and shrimp and it was simply off the charts good. We went to five pairs of gloves in about 40 napkins. It was absolutely amazing. one of the reasons I'm so crazy about this place is that it looks like a little hole-in-the-wall place except that it's busy the service is good the prices are reasonable and it was just awesome it's a very unassuming place in an unassuming neighborhood but by God it's your anywhere near there you should go. That is unless you don't like seafood.

Perhaps too oily and maybe not 100% clean? Idk. It's been 30 hrs since we had our Sunday brunch. I am still suffering. My husband and I both had a rough night with our tummies. I left work early today because of that. Flavor-wise there's room for improvement for sure. I usually can't decide if I wanted to eat all the potatoes and the corn first before getting to the seafood because when done right they are like crack! I had a bite of the potato, something was off. It was hard and wasn't cook all the way through with the sauce absorbed. I wasn't crazy about them. :( We had the 1lbs snow crab and 1lbs shrimp combo plus a side of fries - just the right amount of food for two people. The shrimp was big and the quality of the crab was pretty good. We had the House Sauce base with our combo. It was pretty spicy.  I have to say the other boil places in the lower east side tasted better. More sauce and less garlicky. This one is basically smothering the seafood in garlic and butter. It's a bit too much for me. The fries were pretty good. The dipping sauce that came with the fries was quite awesome. A bit spicy but just the right amount of kick. Friendly staff but do need to provide more napkins to customers. seafood boil is a messy business. You can't just give me one piece of napkin and I have to keep asking you to give me more, which you did give me one piece at a time.... Let's hope my tummy issue will go away soon..."

The apps all came with Cajun fries but the waitress gave us the option to switch it to onion rings and salad.  -The oysters, fried to perfection with a side of cajun fries - if this was the only thing I ate this review would a solid 4 stars.  -The fish tacos were just alright, with a chunk of fried fish in a soft flour tortilla it was missing the love, the onion rings were great. -The BBQ (head-on, shell-on) shrimp... I can deal with head-on/shell on shrimp, but these were overcooked and tasted a bit weird, after eating the second one I decided that food poisoning is not worth it and decided to not finish them.  The salad was from a bag of mixed greens.- The pound of mussels... they were the giant New Zealand tough chewy mussels.  The sauce, corn and potatoes were good.  I don't ever need to eat those mussels again.All in all not sure I'd ever go back."

Yesterday was my first time visiting. The place is small with dim lighting that actually makes one enjoy some messy eating in a rather intimate way. Even though the place is on the smaller side, there is ample amount of seating both for small groups and larger groups. I came here with my sister and we ordered 1lb shrimp and 1lb mussels in the oceanic boil sauce. We also got garlic bread and Cajun fries with spicy mayo for the table. First off, this was my first time ever trying seafood boil and I am blown away at how flavorful and filling this meal was. The sauce was an excellent combo of spicy, sweet and garlicky. I love that it also comes with potatoes and corn which I devoured in seconds because it was that good. The fries were also my favorite. For two people, the amount of food we ordered was more than enough (we had to take some to go because it was so much). If you're ever in doubt of what to try the shrimp and mussels are a safe bet for sure. I highly recommend this place!!"

I ordered a dozen oysters that were horrible. They had no taste whatsoever. Not quite sure if they were overly rinsed/cleaned or whether they were frozen but they absolutely were the worst I've ever had.  The table next to us also placed an order and mentioned to us that they thought the same. They were asking other tables if they wanted them as they couldnt even finish eating them. The shrimp basket, calamari basket and snow crab legs however were amazing! Hoping they try to improve the quality of their oysters."

My friends and I left stuffed but happy, which is pretty much exactly what you'd hope for any time you go out to eat.Food: The oceanic mix sauce is truly incredible, I almost licked the bag clean! We tried every spice level and each one was perfect butttt just know, the oceanic mix is spicy on its own. Extra spicy and super spicy just takes it to the next level, which is perfect if you love spicy :) We tried snow crabs, stone crabs, clams and shrimp. I would definitely recommend the snow crabs and clams, so delicious! The potatoes and corn that come with each bag is such a treat. We ordered some nice warm garlic bread which was a nice accompaniment to the meal. I also had an amazing virgin piña colada. So overall: yum. Service and ambiance: this place is a little hole in the wall, which made it super cozy. The music was really good, my friends and I sang along to some great throwbacks. Our table neighbors were singing along as well! There was such a fun happy vibe. The waiters were very friendly and helpful and always had a smile on their faces. They give us bibs and gloves, but it still gets messy and I honestly think it adds to the fun of it. If you love seafood and you want to have a good time, I'd definitely recommend this place!"

We also ordered the prawns and crab basket with the spicy butter garlic sauce -if given the chance I would've licked the bag containing the seafood.

Garlic butter + Lemon pepper seasoning it was delicious! He did tell me crawfish wasn't in season but they were good. The snow crab was amazing , the corn is nice and sweet everything was really good. It's like eating something of off Instagram lol! We also had calamari but those were okay.Second time: 1lb Snow Crab with 1lb of shrimp 2 potatoes 1 Corn. Cajun Style (Garlic All Day) also very delicious! If you like more of the seafood taste then season go with this one it's just a little more subtle. Ordered on the phone and the hospitality was great, place is small but feels homey.

Even though we were full, I would've eaten more. We shared the Lobster, Crawfish, and Shrimp with the Oceanic sauce. THE SAUCE! omggggg. The drinks were pretty delicious and mildly strong. The servers were also really amazing and made the experience super fun. Also, they played the jams from the early 00's which gets an A+. I've been to other boil places in the city (which I won't name) and Oceanic Boil takes the cake!

I mean, it's seafood and it's a boil...add some old bay, some crazy spice level and charge an arm and a leg.At least, that's what I expected yesterday after stopping in for an early dinner with the family. I was pleasantly surprised that their mild spice, WAS ACTUALLY mild. In addition, most places kind of blur together because their boil is rally just the sharp bite of old bay seasoning with some garlic. Oceanic Combo had the base layer of old bay, but then there were other layers of flavor in the sauce that I wound up going back to dip my seafood, corn and potatoes in. It almost tasted like there was a mild coconut curry layer in their sauce. Whatever it was, the flavor was delicious. The ONLY complaint I have is their portions were slightly less than I would have liked. They claim their Oceanic Combo feeds four people.  At first glance, I could have finished the entire thing by myself. Then again...I can eat. lol"

We got calamari for an appetizer which comes with cajun fries and Siracho mayo - delicious! For my entree I got a combo of shrimp and snow crab legs (1 lb) with the garlic butter + lemon pepper sauce which comes with corn and potatoes. My aunt got the clams casino and lobster mac and cheese. Everything was bursting with flavor esp the butter sauce. The lobster mac and cheese was so good I even ordered one to take home.

I loved the fact that the staff informed us that fresh crawfish season had ended and that what they were serving was the frozen variety, so we could substitute it for more of one of the other items in the combo of we chose. Thought that was pretty kick ass and thoughtful to the customer. Wish more places did that!Loved everything about this place, will definitely be back very soon!"

This seafood restaurant based in Jackson Heights is the first of hopefully more absolutely wonderful restaurants in the neighborhood.Everything tastes fresh and I honestly can't get enough of everything. Their Cajun fries are delicious, their appetizers are superb, and the mains are tasty, messy, and fun to eat. For their mains they even now give you the option of how spicy you want your sauce to be, which is a great idea and let me tell you, it's pretty hot. This establishment is small so make a reservation if you can since it gets very crowded. Hopefully they might expand in the future to accommodate more people, so that we all might enjoy eating it."

Some of the clam meat were really small compared to the shell. But overall the buttery garlicky sauce was so addicting and I couldn't help but smother the shrimp in it!Garlic Noodles- wasn't my favorite if I had to compare the flavor to everything else. But if you mix the noodles with the clam/garlic butter sauce it does make it more flavorful."

Love their seafood! Their butter based sauces are amazing! Service is great, I've never had an issue. The place is a little snug, the wait could be a bit long for larger parties.

I came during happy hour and was sad to see that the happy hour had less items than 5 months ago. Only appetizers and a few drinks are on the happy hour menu now...Despite that hiccup, I placed an order for mussels with garlic butter sauce. I don't really get the point of the potatoe so the waitress let me know she can just give me an extra piece of corn instead.You get gloves and a bib to conquer your seafood deliciousness.Man were the mussels delicious especially since they were freshly boiled! Some were orange while others were a tan color. I'm no seafood expert so I don't know if it made a difference but everything was yummy in my tummy. I got 1lb of mussels which equals 12 mussels with two pieces of corn.The bathrooms are really clean which is always a plus in my book. And with the receipt they give you mint candies and a wet nap.

Garlic bread was a delicious compliment to the mussels and crab and was only $3. The oceanic seasoning is a mix of all their different seasoning options and it was so buttery, spicy and garlicky. We liked the mussels the most since they were cooked perfectly and the sauce was infused well. We also liked the potatoes and corn but would've liked to see sausages in there."

He made a couple of mistakes with my order but was very apologetic about it and fixed it right away--no questions asked.FoodI would have given this place 4 stars even if it wasn't for the subpar food. I ordered the snow crab leg with their house sauce. I have tried crab in many different restaurants and states and I can tell you that this one was just okay. The sauce was tasty and slightly spicy but not as flavorful as i hoped. The cajun fries were good though.Price fair, probably a little cheaper than in Manhattan.Overall cute restaurant with good service and average seafood."

The restaurant is cozy.  The chairs are interesting (the back is just a bar) not really to comfortable but manageable.  It's tight quarters so be ready to share your space.  The food was really good! I got the oceanic special (mild) and then had them add some lemon pepper. Hubby got the oceanic special and added extra spicy.  It was the combo meals of crab/shrimp and crab/crawfish.  To note, shrimp had the heads still on them .  When we got there it was happy house.  Their white wine was aPinot Grigio.

I wasn't very hungry and didn't plan on eating much but I couldn't stop eating. The flavor was out of this world. The seafood was fresh. The lobster was perfection!!!

Don't expect any exemplary service here, as the past two test visits has shown nothing but a good lack of common sense.

Spicy, add a bit of lemon juice and boom!!! Party in your mouth!!!!Even though I only stopped to pick up my food, the employees were very nice.Would definitely be back and try the crawfish.

Oysters $1, frozen drinks like sake pina colada $5.50. The old bay seasoning was perfect. Wasn't too salty and just the right amount of spice.

But it'd be a lie. The truth is, this place is great, I just don't like waiting for a table. What's so great? Oh, IDK, have you ever looked at the ocean and said ""Yes, please, with extra butter""? Welp, now you can. Crab legs, mussels, shrimp, crawfish, all those things. Corn so you feel like you're eating vegetables? Sure, whatever, throw it in. I've been to several boil joints, and this one is definitely the most difficult/costly to get to for me, but the one I keep coming back to. But I gave it 4 stars, so here it is: One time they gave someone else my table. They said we have the next table, and then they gave it to someone else that they clearly knew. That was real uncool, because as I mentioned above, I don't like waiting, and I had already waited a very long time. So to watch someone sit in the seat that should be mine? Yeah, not into it."

Better late than never though lol. Came here with my bestie to meet up for dinner with a future employer. We came around 4 or 5pm so it was fairly quiet except for us and another group at another table. We waited quite a while for the 3rd person to show up and the waitress was friendly about it. I use this time to look around the restaurant. The decor is cute,beachy feel and casual which is just right for a seafood boil spot. He finally shows up and we order right away. He gets the snow crab legs and my gf and I get the Oceanic combo which has a little of everything.Some shrimp,crawfish,snow crab legs,lobster,corn and potatoes. It took a VERY long time for it to come out. So if you have time to kill by all means eat here lol. When it did arrive it was soooo delicious. We opted for the sauce that has a lil of everything and it was perfect. Just the right amount of flavor and spice. The seafood was perfectly cooked. Especially the lobster which was amazeballs. I could not stop eating once I started. If I had anything to critique was that the potatoes were way undercooked and they only give you two tiny pieces of corn. And sausage should be added as well for that smoky flavor. For such a big entree there should def have been more. When I return I will just say less potatoes and more corn please. We didn't eat dessert since we were so stuffed. But as a huge seafood lover I'm def on planning on going back for my fix and it's walking distance from me. As far as prices I don't know since our employer treated. Go check it out!"

I take my Yelp ratings very seriously and decided to give them a shot! So glad I did!This place's calling card is by far the crab and lobster. I mean, they offer about 5 different sauces you can have your or lobster mixed in. I went for the spicy garlic butter sauce and boy was it terrific. Scarfed on a pound of king crab cluster that were gigantic! The crab meat was so sweet and fresh and the butter sauce marinade complemented it so well! It's safe to say I will definitely be going back to get more of the yummy crab this place serves up! If you are looking for some fresh and tasty crab/lobster but aren't looking to get socked in the mouth with crazy menu prices, give this place a try. You won't be disappointed!"

A good family place with a small bar in the back. The food looked good but wasn't super. I would go back and give them another chance when I'm in the area.

So happy I tried this place out last night !!!! It was DELICIOUS and everything I wanted out of a seafood boil.  Been trying to find a place that serves seafood like this and I was so excited. We got two Oceanic Combos for a table of 5 people & it was perfect! 1 Combo we got with Garlic Butter sauce and the other combo we got with Oceanic Boil Sauce (spicy) - both so yummy! The garlic butter was my favorite for sure though. All of the seafood was greattt and I loved that we all got to wear bibs and gloves while devouring this food haha. It's such a perfect place to go if you love seafood.

Mainly because they have matcha flan on the menu lol. Finally got to try it a couple of weeks ago. We got the crab legs and shrimp combo with spicy garlic butter & old bay sauce. OMG sooo delish!!! My only complaint is they could be a little more genorous with the potatoes and corn it comes with. There was half a piece of corn and barely any whole pieces of potatoes. C'mon these are not expensive. Not  knowing exactly how much food we'd be getting, that's all we ordered. In the end we weren't too full. So I ordered the Cajun mac n' cheese after we finished the seafood. It was very good. Of course I had to order the flan. Well, to be honest, it was a bit disappointing, as I really didn't taste matcha. But as far as the food, it was really good and will definitely be returning."

Loved the garlic butter marinade sauce they use on the boil. Clams were plump and fresh. Oysters were ok ( fresh but small). My husband really enjoyed his king crab. I also had stone crab claws but would prob get different next time. Drinks are also great.

Aaand I don't want this place crowded because I don't want to have to wait in lines. But let me just tell you why this is my hidden gem. First of all their SPICY GARLIC BUTTER is life. The first cell that ate a mitochondria to become a complex life form thought that it was drenched in spicy garlic butter from oceanic boil. I've been coming here for maybe three years now and I'm sorry Oceanic Boil crew, can't believe it took me this long to write a review. I always get 2lb of snow crab legs (~$20 a pound) for me and my lady, 1 lb of massive mussels (I think it was ~$13 and it's not the cheap shit you buy frozen in a box), 1 dollar oyster minimum of 8 (during happy hour so happy me). Also I like to get the fries and the soft shell crab time to time because the spice mayo sauce is muy bien gue. 3 dollar beers like corona with lime and 5 dollar cocktails that are just so great *tearing*They also got dungeons crab, lobsters, shrimp, crawfish, stone crab claws, king crab legs, lobster rolls, kind attentive servers, cocktail bar, nice decoration that makes you feel like your at a warph somewhere by the sea but really you in the midst of Jackson height. They also got delivery, I think 5 or 6 different sauces for your seafood btw. And if you go there despite my useless warning I just want to let you know to grab a napkin cuz your gonna drool in that moment where the servers come out the back door in slow motion shaking your bag of delicious goodness walking towards you. it's gonna get hot in there."

When you walk in it's a little dark with the expected sea decor. Greeted instantly by the kind waitresses right when we walked in. Hourly street parking out in front - saw a lot of cars go in and out during peak rush hour time (Friday around 5pm-6pm).Now the food:We went for happy hour (Monday through Friday 4p-7p) and first had the $1 oysters, pina colada, and mango daiquiri. Alcohol could be a little stronger, but they made up for it with the delicious main entrees. My girlfriend got the lobster roll and it looked great - they definitely were generous with the amount of lobster. I ordered the snow crab legs (1 lb.) with spicy garlic butter and old bay sauce. Mind blowing! The flavors made me feel like I was on a food network show I couldn't believe it. This place just has solid good food that's hard to find. Be prepared to get a little messy - they do provide gloves and bib!Staff was also extremely polite and surprisingly considerate (you don't get that very often). Checked up on us just enough not to be annoying, but close enough that if we needed something they were available and approachable. Will definitely go back again."

Started with fried catfish and french fries ‍I've had better, but it was fried and fresh.  Flavor was a little lacking in the batter.  For dinner I ordered  mussels in garlic butter, which were on point.  Garlic butter has a balanced flavor, not overly garlicky. I also got crab legs and shrimp in the oceanic boil sauce, which was really nice with a little spice.  My Margarita was ok and my date had one of the signature rum cocktails, which left him a little giddy.  No place outdoes The Boil in the city, but I will def be back!  If you're a seafood lover in Queens, try it out."

We made reservations for 5 people midday on a Saturday. We were immediately seated by the hostess. We ordered drinks and appetizers. The strawberry pina colada is amazing. Everything served was fresh. We had the fried shrimp appetizer that's served with French fries, crab cakes and garlic bread. It was so good. For our meals, we tried so many different items. I had the snow crab legs with shrimp, corn on the cob and potatoes with the garlic butter sauce. Make sure you tell them to take the head off the shrimp. The waitress brought out gloves, bibs and a bucket. The food was seasoned to perfection. I will definitely be going back to this establishment. One hint: Parking is a mess. So be prepared to search for a spot."

We shared the combo: 1 lb snow crab leg & 1 lb of crawfish with the Oceanic Boil sauce (asked for mild) and an order of the garlic noodles & fries. Everything was super super DELICIOUS! Noodles were nicely buttered and garlicky, the fries were good with a delicious sauce,and the seafood....GREAAAT. I would definitely without a doubt recommend this place to everyone especially if you're a seafood lover. Cute space too & good happy hour deals!"

I call almost every single other day for delivery & they always tell me ""minimum is 20.00 "" okay fine nest day I call they tell me 50.00 delivery when I only live like 6 blocks away. Now I call today and they say 25.00 delivery fee. What type manger is running this business you just lost a great customer I used to order all the time now I won't because you're telling me exactly how much to spend. Are you kidding me ? I get it if you say minimum 10-15 buy every time I call you tell me 20, 25 & even once 50.00 delivery fee just Bc it was ""busy"" food is good could never complain but the fact that you're telling me how much to spend that's crazy I nightly recommend you guys to never order from this place ever again"

We didn't wait too long to get a table (like around 5-10 minutes). But if you want to come during the busy hour, it's better to make a reservation (cuz the place it's not big, and sometimes it's very packed). I love seafood, especially clams and crabs, so that's what I usually get. Rich taste and fresh, I enjoyed their food a lot. You might feel very salty after eating that, need to drink some water. Anyway, I still like it and will come back again."

A friend and I shared a ""Oceanic Combo"" based on reviews and were not displeased with either the quantity or variety of seafoods, including clams, shrimp, Alaskan King Crab, and a one pound lobster (with two half ears of corn and a couple of small potatoes. The gimmick at this restaurant is to blend all this with a massive amount of spicy dressing, and have you wear disposable gloves to manage handling the squishy mess. Being somewhat of a purist, I asked for dressing on the side. The first cup of dressing was simply too much over taste so I had it replaced with butter and garlic for a little dipping. Overall, the food quality was fair to good. but by no means exceptional. Things I found to be annoying was having to signal the young waitresses when needed for anything, as they were not paying attention to the table, even though at 2:30 PM only four out of twelve tables were occupied. And I found it classless being served ice cream in a plastic cup along with small cheap plastic spoons. Three stars is being generous for the $100.00 spent."

Service was decent, everyone was very friendly which was pleasant. I started with the oceanic sangria which was actually strong and good. My friends ordered the crab chowder and the fiesta clams (can't remember the name exactly) and both of these apps were really good, especially the soup! I had the wings which were very tasty and crispy and the fries were hot fresh crispy and seasoned. For the boil I got snow crab and shrimp with the oceanic sauce, spicy. It was amazing. It came out piping hot, the crab was juicy and the sauce was thick and sooo good. It wasn't too salty like a lot of other boil spots I've been to. I had a really great experience and definitely will be back for more!"

Went there with a couple of co workers who only eat seafood and they loved it! The portions were decent. My favorite would be the calamari and fries and the shrimp and lobster tasted amazing.

My man and I usually eat a lot but the chicken wings starter and the 1 lb. crab leg with 1 lb. of shrimp filled us up. We shared it but could have probably ordered our own combos and finished them; we'll do that next time. I would recommend trying the spicy garlic butter with old bay - delicious! A plus for me is that they provided us with gloves to eat with. I appreciated that because, where I'm from, you just leave with hands that smell for the rest of the week.

We came here last night around 7pm and there was no wait. It was actually pretty empty but then again it was a freezing cold Monday night. It was the two of us and we ordered the calamari basket, garlic noodles, oysters and one of the combos. Calamari basket ($10) - It comes with cajun fries, a dipping sauce and a small cup of corn. The breading was a little meh but besides that, it was alright. Oysters ($1)- They had a $1 special for oysters and minimum of 8 oysters per order. We are complete suckers for oysters so we automatically ordered 8. The sauce was a little thicker than the usual sauce you get with oysters. The oysters were really good compared to other $1 oyster spots. There were no sand and no excess salt water on the oysters which is always a good thing! Combo ($50)- dungeness crab + 1 pound of crawfishI love the fact that the waitress was so honest to us. She told us crawfish was not in season at the moment and that we would be getting frozen crawfish instead.  Personally, I don't understand the hype over crawfish anymore. I used to love it but the more I eat it, the more I realize to myself, ""damn it takes way too much work to eat so little meat"". She also allowed us to replace it, so we replaced it with shrimp. The seafood was super fresh and the garlic butter sauce was so savory. The shrimps were meaty and the crab tasted super fresh! Garlic noodles ($5)I'm a sucker for anything garlic, so of course I had to order it. and I'm so glad I did. I've had better garlic noodles but I really liked this too. I actually love just throwing the garlic noodles into the garlic butter from the combo. That taste heavenly! I wasn't able to try out any drinks because I was having a hangover, but will def come by next time and give it a shot. (haha pun intended). The waitress was super friendly and made sure to keep checking up on us. The bus boy kept refilling our drinks and cleaned up whenever we were making a mess. Praying that my review doesn't hype this place up, so I won't have to be waiting next time to get in! I really wish I took some pictures, but I was way too hungry for that."

The food is really good, I love seafood so this is heaven to me. The butter sauce can be heavy but it's very flavorful and delicious.I always get the catfish sliders and the combo of crawfish and shrimp. The food is always fresh and if the crawfish are out of season they tell you beforehand. That's honesty that a lot of businesses don't have. Wether the crawfish is or isn't season doesn't matter because the frozen ones are just as good if not better. They are significantly larger than the fresh ones with exactly the same taste.The staff is very friendly and attentive, no complaints when it comes to service. The bartender made our drinks strong and I had a light buzz after one so sip responsibly folks.The atmosphere is casual and a great spot to kick back but can also be cute for a date. If you don't mind seeing your partner covered in sauce."

The food is delicious. We had calamari which is served with fries. Has a nice kick to it. The gumbo is very flavorful and delicious. We went with the crab legs and shrimp in the oceanic boil sauce. It was served with potatoes and corn. We added sausage which was grilled and then added to the boil...perfection. Drinks were a little too sweet for me but who cares? I came for the seafood. Service was attentive and fast. I'll definitely be back soon.

The music, the food, and the experience. After waiting an hour or so to be seated (make reservations on a Friday night if you plan to go) it finally began. I ordered the mac n cheese appetizer and it was unexpectedly good.  One order can be shared with two people.  Next time I will order it with lobster.  My entree included shrimp and crab legs in garlic butter sauce.  Looooovvvvveeeed it! Warning.....If you don't want the head on your shrimp be sure to mention it when you order.  I didn't mind.  The only reason I gave this restaurant four stars and not five has to so with the music used to celebrate someone's birthday. The music is absolutely great until you hear the classic cajun funeral music, slow and somber in the beginning and then upbeat after a few minutes. I was disappointed at first but found myself  moving to it after the 3rd time it was played. But I was also drinking my Oceanic Sagria which relaxed my nerves, lol. All in all I had a great time."

The seafood wasn't that fresh at all, so of course that killed the taste and quality of this whole dinning experience.Pro:*Loved the well prepared set up with the utensils, bowl holding the bag of food so it doesn't leak, and the almost apron size bib provided (outstanding!!)*Takes credit cards, Amex included*Linda, our very friendly server, she let me try a little of the spicy sauce before I placed my first order, and it wasn't the kind of spicy that would linger and numb your tongue for hours. But a nice kick that you can feel the heat by your throat for a minute and then slowly dissipates.*Bf said his drinks were good (IPA beer and Oceanic Passion fruit drink with sake)* They can do sauce on the side, in case you prefer dipping into a cup as you eat. :)*They offer delivery ! And we were able to wrap leftovers to go.Con:*Overall staff wasn't attentive and there were two other couples there tonight. Our water was never refilled, and the other girl was more into singing to the music and staring at the TV. * Charges extra for sauce, even though seafood portion vs sauce isn't taken into consideration when mixing in the bag. They just give you this one size cup of sauce for any size order....which is inconsiderate ..who ever is in the kitchen or made this rule, clearly doesn't cook for large amounts and knows adjustments for seasoning amount is required!!!* SEAFOOD WASN'T FRESH!!....big no no....* My bf said Popeye's has better Cajun fries than this place...:/ and soft shell crabs he ordered was so/so. (folks...he is very easily pleased when it comes to food.)Lastly, the green tea flan ....was more like pudding, didn't taste bad...but nothing like a traditional flan texture at all ....but the coconut flan tastes pretty good. (It's sweeter tho and thicker texture)"

I'm a huge seafood lover and their seafood is better than most seafood restaurants in the city. It's truly a hidden gem in Queens. I've tried other more known seafood boil restaurants and they don't compare. Their oceanic boil sauce is the best seafood sauce I've ever had it's absolutely scrumptious!!!! Their cajun shrimp and sausage gumbo is also delicious and tastes very authentic to the gumbo in Nola. It's is a must have for me every time I visit. Their seafood is always fresh and the portions are plentiful. The prices are also reasonable for the quality and quantity. By far much tastier and better priced than some other seafood boil restaurants.

Don't wear your Sunday best because you will get messy.  I only tried the garlic butter sauce, but since I'm a purist, maybe next time I'll do no sauce at all and just enjoy the seafood as is.  The bar kept the drinks flowing and everyone had a fabulous time.  Parking is a nightmare, so subway or cab it."

He was referred by a friend. The waitlist here on Yelp is amaaaaazing! It gives you updates in real time and what time your table is ready! We arrived and the table was ready. Our waiter was very nice. We got the lobster mac and cheese, which is just regular mac n cheese but the lobster on it was good. I recommend changing up the pasta and adding different cheeses and a little more lobster to justify the $18. We got the fries, which came with a spicy ketchup, which is probably spicy mayo or sriratcha ketchup with was reaaal good! For the entree, we got the Oceanic Boil special, which comes with a pound of shrimp, crawfish, lobster, crab legs, and some potatoes and some corn. We subbed the crawfish for shrimp because we both don't eat it. It was only $1 more. They give you gloves and a bib to eat and wipes afterwards. Overall, that oceanic sauce was bomb, not spicy for me at all!"

So much better then the trend shaking crab. Only downfall is the place is kinda small, and they dont take reservations on weekends. Waiter is attentive and drinks are good. Calamari is also tasty. Got the strawberry pina colada with a kick, and the combo with 1lb of shrimp and snow crab legs. Pina colada definitely had a kick but it was subtle. The crab legs and shrimp had garlic butter on it and was meaty and sweet. Hands down a good place to come to. Perfect size for 4 people. Anything over that it's kinda tricky to seat. Definitely worth checking out"

Returning from a visit home to KC, I wanted some seafood close to LGA. This place was sooo good. Now keep in mind the happy hour wings and calamari come with fries so there will be plenty to share. I had the snow crab legs with shrimp. It comes with potatoes and corn. My Lord. We arrived right at 5pm before the evening rush. Keep in mind it's Tuesday. The oceanic sauce for the crab legs had just enough kick. Great balance of spice, lemon , butter and garlic. Word to the wise--use the gloves chile! I started without them, because I'm an ol' pro. The sauce is so abundantly present, you save a rainforest of trees using gloves instead of asking for napkins. To drink I had the sake mango deal. It was pretty tasty but but you for the food not the drinks. The liquids just take up space for the food. Let's be clear I ate all the crab and couldn't finish all of the shrimp. Just a heads up --the heads are on the shrimp so if that's not your thing let them know. The service was very attentive and welcoming. They even asked if we had complaints. They also inquired whether or not we liked it because we had some leftover! There was simply no room in my belly!If you are still reading this review just stop and make your way to oceanic boil geeeesh!"

Been waiting for this place to open for a while now, so glad it did. The  ratings are for the customer service and interaction we received today from the owners and staff. Starting with the staff, very welcoming, friendly and attentive. The owners also came over to check on us and see how we were enjoying things. Being that I'm from LA, I told him my experience about the Boiling Crab and the Boil in NY, making some suggestions and recommendations to him about their menu items, sauce etc. I loved that he was super open to suggestions and recommendations and actually listening to what I had to say. Definitely helps knowing they value their customers opinions.Coming to the food...we had the fried calamari for appetizer which was great! Just recommend making it slightly bigger in portion and perhaps charging more to go accordingly. My husband and I then shared the Dungeness Crab and 1lb of Shrimp with the house special sauce. The sauce was interesting and definitely different from the boil or boiling crab...but we enjoyed it! I feel the shrimp portion was slight less compared to other places so highly recommend more shrimp for the price. As for the Dungeness Crab, I'd probably recommend the snow crab legs over it just due to preference.Overall, I definitely recommend trying this place out and supporting the business due to reasons listed above. I hope my recommendations are considered to give this place higher ratings the second time around!"

I highly recommend this place. I found this little gem while browsing Yelp for seafood restaurants. Upon looking at the reviews I decided to give it a try. I called first to see if reservations were required. All through a reservation wasn't required I would highly recommend it for group 4 or more and anytime after 6:00pm Upon arrival my friend and I were greeted and seated immediately. The decor give you a feeling of ocean/boat type of feeling, it's was very clean and didn't have a Fishy type of smell. Also it isn't very big it's more of an intimate settings. For an appetizer I order the Catfish strips that came with fries, a corn salsa, and tarter sauce. The catfish was omg good, nice and crunchy. The fries had an authentic taste as if they used a secret seasoning, the corn salsa with fresh and had an little spice to it. For my entree I had one of the seafood combo's, which included snow crab legs, shrimp, corn on the cob, & red potatoes with the garlic butter sauce. My friend had the crawfish & snow crab legs and shrimp combo with the spicy garlic. I swear that garlic butter sauce was the best I ever tasted. I swear I wanted to take some of the garlic sauce home. The shrimp & snow crab leg combo was $35.00, definitely worth the price considering the serving sizes.

We've been missing out!Only downsides: 1) Acoustics are really loud, so inconsiderate parties like the one next us, make it very hard to hear each other and my ears are ringing, but the 90's R&B and hip hop help make up for it. 2) I'm a bit of a tree-hugger and can't help but have a heavy conscience about all the plastic waste (bags, bibs, cups; also all the rubber gloves, which are nonetheless brilliantly useful). But the food is OUTSTANDING!!!"

Price is reasonable. The staff is friendly and very attentive. My favorite is the sauce. The oceanic sauce is very good. Especially spicy. I was super happy when I found out they do home delivery. If you are looking for a night in food or don't want to eat anything heavy before a big night out. This is the best place to go to.

I only sipped on my mom's daiquiri but it was good. We had lobster shrimp and crab legs spicy and lemon pep. It was not overly garlicky like other places (not too far away ) im all about the crab so it was awesome for me nice fresh snow crab legs that were not small or dried out. Parking is horrible

I thought the snow crab meat was a bit too salty on its own that you can taste the sweetness of the meat. However, the saltiness with the sauce and a bit of white rice was such a good combo. The Dungeness crab was perfectly cooked though be ready to ""clean"" it since it's a whole attached crab."

I like this place a lot, the sauce is thick and VERY flavorful. Lobster was sweet and juicy, I personally think crawfish wasn't worth the money because there wasn't much to eat. Catfish wasn't overly greasy or battered and the drinks were delicious, forgot the price but it was cheap! Staffs were working hard and super friendly. For sure coming back!!"

The staff is wonderful, especially since they seem to be doing multiple jobs (bar, wait staff, and bussing tables). Also, They give a toothpick/fork contraption that helps you get the meat out of the crab legs. I chose the garlic butter sauce and it was alittle salty. My lemon drop martini was ok. All in all, it's a convenient  spot located in queens if you don't want to travel to the city or city island for your seafood craving."

Really simple but appreciative oceanic themed. Seats are made of metal and uncomfortable due to being tiny and bare metal. Staff were very friendly and helped us first-timers choose off the menu. She also gave us two sauces on the side to try first before choosing. We ordered the crawfish and shrimp combo... This was my time trying crawfish. It was tiny and had pretty much no meat. So half the entree was a waste of money, but nothing to blame them for. The shrimps were sizable and fair amount. Unfortunately even though they were smothered pretty well, the sauce didn't seemed to stick and even tasted lighter / less flavorful. To make things worse, the gloves they provided smelled and everytime my hand came close to my mouth I lost my appetite because of it. In the middle of our eating, the waitress asked how things were and to give her honest reviews on the spot. So I mentioned everything lol. All in all, it's a great idea and addition to the neighborhood but for my first time here im disappointed. Worth a try. P. S - don't get crawfish! Unless you're a crawfish lover, and if you are, crawl back fish."

Its Wednesday night and the place is packed. After about a 15 minute wait we are seated. We orderd the shrimp basket as an appertizer and my buddy ordered a lemonade cocktail. The shrimp basket (about 8 small shrimp with spicy fries) came out in a reasonable time . Nothing special about the shrimp. Actually the fries were better than the shrimp...Im not much of a seafood person so I ordered the Angus steak(medium) with sauteed spinach. My buddy ordered a whole lobster and crab legs, which came with potatoes and corn on the cob. After finishing the shrimp basket my buddy informed the waiter that he was still waiting on his drink. After about another 7 minutes ny buddy recieved his drink. My steak dinner came out first, I figured his seafood meal would be coming out immediately after(even though they should have been brought out together) so I started on my meal. My steak was seasoned well but it was well done and not medium as I requested. No big deal,I continue eating my dinner. Spinach was average. I finished my entire meal before my buddy food was brought out. He said he was satisfied with his meal as it was well seasoned and delicious...At this point im just ready to leave. ...So its a good spot for seafood lovers, but still a little rough around the edges. I would probably dine there again with one of my seafood loving friends or family"

We were getting excited for a good meal.When the lobster, crawfish, and snow crab legs arrived...disaster.None of the food was hot. Lukewarm at best. There was barely any sauce and the quality of the seafood was just alright.I've been to other boil places and definitely had better experiences there than here.Sorry Oceanic Boil :/ I really wanted to like you"

I was looking for a new seafood place and somehow I decided on Queens. Oceanic boil is tucked away in a tight cozy dim lit spot on the block if your not paying attention or not using gps it's possible to miss it. It was busy but there wasn't no wait to sit down. There are chairs along the wall and uncomfortable stools in the floor space that I get is there for efficiency but had my butt been a bit bigger, I wouldn't be able to sit there comfortably. The food was pretty good. I enjoyed my fried shrimp and French fries what I didn't like was the so called lobster Mac and cheese. The lobster mac and cheese contained 1 half of a 1oz lobster tail that was chopped up and put on top of the Mac and cheese. I am not exaggerating that either there was no additional pieces of lobster in the dish and the mac and cheese tasted very similar to the nasty kraft mac and cheese from my likkle youth days. I get that it's a business but to charge $18 dollars for that?? I felt like I got robbed forreal. It was decent food but I wouldn't leave Brooklyn to come back here."

Everything we ordered was super yummy and we downed it with beer. The shrimp was large in size, unlike other boil restaurantsThe staff are super attentive and they keep on refilling your water.Definitely will come back.

TBH I don't recommend ordering delivery for boils b/c obviously it's best served fresh anywho I was pleasantly surprised. It seems they've reverted to using the original sauce w/garlic chunks & all. It also hit the spot. I didn't regret this decision at all! Will be back to visit or even order delivery soon =)

I recommend that you go with some that likes to eat and likes seafood because they serve a lot of food and is all seafood. We ordered the Oceanic Combo, i think i wasn't impressed because the seasoning didn't let me taste the seafood flavor. They do give you a lot of seafood for the price. I really liked the decoration and the cozy atmosphere"

The place is a little dark, but I'll call it ambience. I was wondering why we were  given rubber gloves. Ta da! The gloves were to protect your hands from the seasoning on the food. I had shrimp and it had the heads on and obviously were  not cleaned. I had to devein the shrimp and try to wipe out as much of the intestine as possible.  My daughter had crawfish that she said were tasteless. Because of the in the bag seasoning and shaking, the corn and potatoes were delicious. If you don't mind the working and cleaning, enjoy. It was quite the experience."

Oceanic boil was good, the seafood was fresh. Their oceanic boil special sauce has a nice kick. The server was nice to give us a heads up that crawfish was out of season and that they were frozen, but for frozen crawfish, they were pretty good.We ordered a combo of 1lb shrimp and 1lb crawfish with an extra pound of shrimp also the seafood mac and cheese. The seafood mac and cheese were okay, you can pass on that. The crawfish were pretty big. Each pound of seafood came with a corn and potato. The corn was sweet and the potato soaked up the seasoning making it flavorful. Only complaint my friend and I have is that we wished they would attempt to clean the back vein/dirt of the shrimp. But for the most part they're good. Service was very friendly and attentive."

I really wanted to give a better rating but, in all fairness, had to settle with overall 3 stars. From the outside, it's a tiny storefront so you can walk past by without realizing it. Space is narrow and long but, decorated throughout the restaurant. Interior and the bathroom was clean, server was nice, nothing to complain about there. Menu had a lot of items.  We ordered several items and the waiting began. Hum.. there was nothing that stood out nor, very flavorful enough to be praised. We wondered how it received so many 5 star ratings and, I kept looking through the menu to order more items.Shrimp was okay.. garlic butter sauce was pretty standard. Noodles were better flavored than the seafood. At the time of order, they were honest about some items we ordered were not fresh but, frozen. From this visit, oysters were the best part of the entire meal... they were served fresh and cold."

Took a little while to come out but it is made fresh so that's to be expected. We went on a Monday so it wasn't too busy. The staff was nice. The chairs are a little hard though. Enjoyed myself.

Especially for how much seafood they give you. I live for the garlic butter sauce, I would double dip my shrimp in the bottom of the bowl it's that good."

Crab legs are extremely meaty and juicy, no matter what time of year they are delicious. The crawlfish is rich and the texture is just right, the wait staff always informs you whether or not it is in season. I order it once when it was not in season, and it is noticeable when it comes to the texture of the meat.Now the sauces are extremely tasty, my favorite has to be the garlic butter Lemon pepper. I tried the oceanic boil sauce once (mixture of all sauces) and it just too much; the sauce has to much going on and it completely mask the taste of the seafood.If you come, you must order the garlic noodles. It's garlicy buttery what can go wrong with that.A huge plus to the place: the beers are dirt cheap."

Thank Goodness for the option to ""Join the waitlist"" for this particular restaurant because as soon as we arrived, we were up next on the list to be seated and maybe had to wait only 5 minutes. It was our first time here so we asked the waitress for her recommendations. Ultimately we decided on sharing the Oceanic Combo with their mild oceanic sauce and OH. MY. GOD. hands down the BEST seafood I've ever had!! Usually, I develop an allergic reaction right away to eating seafood if it's not fresh, which was not the case with the seafood here. You can just tell the difference with the way it tastes. Their drinks were also pretty bomb. Place is clean and small, staff is super friendly. My one and only complaint is that the restaurant is located in an area where parking is almost close to none. We got lucky and found street parking quite a few blocks away with circling around the neighborhood twice."

They serve authentic cuisine from northern Thailand, It's kind of different from the Thai cuisine we are familiar with. The decor is adorable with beautiful drawings on the wall and the ambiance is relaxed & cozy. Their food was amazingly delicious with surprise and creativity. We ordered Angie (Crispy papaya salad with shrimps), Hnam Kadook Moo (fermented pork ribs), Yum Jin Gai and Thai Tea Pad Thai; the portion of each was huge and we ended up bringing all the Pad Thai home. My favorite dish was the Angie. It was my first time to have fried papaya salad and it was super tasty, crispy at the top but wet on the bottom. The mixed texture was extremely addictive. My husband's favorite was Thai Tea Pad Thai which is infused by Thai iced tea. We tried it out of curiosity but with kind of hesitation and felt in love with this delicacy. There are still some options on the menu we would like to try next time. However, there is one complaint that they are Cash and Venmo only ."

This place right off Grand Ave specializes in Northern Thai cuisine and everything is super spicy so come prepared!Be sure to check out their unique Thai Tea Pad Thai along with their spicy Larb Kuy. They have a wide selection of appetizers so it's best to come with a large group and just order a bunch of dishes to share. Also they take reservations if you want to call ahead with a large party.

I hesitate to call the food bland, but that is how I honestly felt about it. The flavors of the dishes were not only not at all spicy, but the ingredients themselves seemed to be used too gently. Nothing stood out, nothing shined, and the quality of the meat and seafood was not very good (overcooked, too much bone, small in size, etc.). Yum Woon Sen (Spicy Glass Noodles Salad) was odd. The noodles were dry, a faint scent of fish sauce wafting off them, with just a hint of spice - but this was still the spiciest dish we ordered. It comes with shrimp and calamari - neither seemed to have any flavor and were small and sparse. Shredded pork, carrots, peanut, and onions rounded this out, it was just a dry, strange salad. The Hat Yai fried chicken was badly overcooked, the meat dry and tasteless. Fried shallots sat oddly at the bottom of the takeout container, and a very small sweet chili sauce did not make up for the meat. Finger Root Pad Kee Mao tasted nothing like any version I've ever had, it's a completely different dish which isn't an issue but I just didn't care for it because it didn't really taste like much. There was no heat whatsoever, and it had a light, airy flavor that I couldn't place. Maybe like a very muted citrus without the bite. The Hnam Kadook Moo (fermented pork ribs) were pretty tasty. This was my first time having fermented meat and I can't say I could taste it. They're bone-in rib tips and a little chewy, not overly so, but there was too much bone for the small amount of meat you got. Their Northern Green Curry was the best item of the night - but not for $17. I have nothing bad to say about it, but nothing amazing either, it had the boldest flavor, but that's not saying much.Their Blue Moon drink was delicious! Fresh coconut slices inside the cup makes this taste exactly like sweet sticky rice in drink form, loved it.Edit to add an extra star: The owners response to my review was incredible. I really appreciate having a new cuisine explained to me, it helps me better understand the flavors, cooking technique, and what to expect, and it's fair that delivery can effect the food. Lamoon didn't have to give such a detailed and thorough response but I'm grateful they did, and they did it with kindness. Thank you!"

We got the northern green curry, the pink pad thai, the yum woon sen and the pearl pad see ew. The northern green curry (4/5) was the best dish out of everything. It had a lot of flavor and it was packed with peppers and chicken. The pink pad thai (1/5) was interesting but nothing special. It looked pretty but the taste was bland and slightly sour. I had to put extra soy sauce and hot sauce. The yum woon sen (2/5) was decent. It was spicy and packed with shrimp and vegetables -very fragrant but smelled too much like fish for my preference. The pad see ew (2/5) was just.. average? It needed more soy sauce or salt. The noodles arrived all stuck together and it was dry. Again, nothing special.Overall, I did not enjoy the food here. I ordered for delivery for me + three of my Thai friends and nobody enjoyed it. There are so many better Thai restaurants around the vicinity. I don't think I'd give this place another try.Delivery: 4/5Came within the expected time frame."

It is reminiscent of listening to the soft flow of waves while sitting by a quiet waterside with a gentle breeze blowing against the blaze of the sun. The color contrast on the stark white walls serve a dual purpose in making the shop feel inviting as well as providing the perfect background for pictures. We ordered the fried lemongrass chicken wings, tum kanoon, yum woon sen, khao soi with chicken, kang hung ley, nam prik ong, rainbow sticky rice and mango, butterfly pea flower juice, and Thai iced tea. The wings were crispy and meaty, the yum woon sen was tangy with a hint of spice, and the pork belly was super tender. The tum kanoon was somewhat of a disappointment. I was looking forward to this dish the most as I love jackfruit but I felt like I couldn't really taste the jackfruit flavor. The khao soi with chicken was my favorite. Its broth was rich and silky smooth and the chicken was juicy and succulent. The rainbow sticky rice with mango was delicious despite being a bit too sweet for my taste. Staff were friendly, attentive and helpful. Street parking is available though it's tough finding a spot. As for public transportation, it is easily accessible by the E, F, R, M, and 7 trains."

I'm here for five days on a self-guided combination work/food tour. To be clear, food is not the subject of my self-employment. That's computer work. My hobby is eating spectacular food, and less than an hour after having lunch here, if someone could foresee the future and tell me this was the best meal of the trip I'd be totally OK with that. And it could be.Nam Prik Noom was the centerpiece of my lunch, savory fried rice in a chili paste with chicken added. Just the right amount of heat, intensely flavorable, perfectly moist. As part of the lunch special I had one appetizer available and chose the fried rice balls which were crisp, crunch and savory, small bits of Thai basil (I believe) protruding and contained within. A wonderful texture to pair with the entree. Two rice dishes at once for lunch? Hell, yea! And a Thai ice tea to boot, sweet, but not cloyingly so. Perfection.Better yet, and especially to my liking, the portion sizes are just right. I get that it's in vogue to serve way too much food for lunch, but please, not everyone wants that. This was just right, not only in portion size, but in every other way possible.Cash only. Seats maybe 20 if packed. Menu is packed with photos of the actual menu, helpful for folks like yours truly. Very highly recommended."

First impressions when I walked in was that there isn't a whole lot of space so it is nice and cozy. If you have a large group of people, I would recommend making a reservation a day or two before so that you can make sure you have a table for your party. If you are going in a small group of 2/3 people you will have a much better chance getting seated right away. The bathroom is located in the back where the kitchen is so if you need to use it just ask your server and they will point you in the direction. The dishes were all very unique and different from your typical thai cuisine. It displays Northern Thai Cuisine which is less sweet but more spicy and savory by using herbal ingredients. We had: Khao Soi Chicken (egg noodle in creamy coconut curry top with crispy noodle On side: shallot, lime slice & pickle lettuce) $12: definitely the highlight dish from the meal. I particularly liked the flavor from the Khao Soi. It had a very rich and flavorful broth and it complimented the egg noodles quite well. The only thing I would say is that the chicken tasted a little dry because the majority of the skin was not there. Thai Tea Pad Thai w/ Shrimp (Thai tea infused rice noodle sauté with tamarind sauce, sweet turnip, black tofu, chive, grounded peanut, beansprout, dried shrimp flake) $14: the technique of infusing the pad thai with thai tea was really interesting and brought a unique flavor/taste to the dish. In my opinion I would still prefer regular pad thai over this dish, but that is a personal preference. Hnam Kadook Moo (Homemade old fashioned fried fermented pork ribs) $9: I don't mind eating meat with bones in it but in my opinion, a lot of the pork ribs were small portions of meat and too much cartilage. I thought the cook and the seasoning of the ribs were acceptable. I definitely recommend trying it and judging it for yourself whether you like it or not but if you are looking for something new to try, this is the perfect place to go.

I got  the tum kanoon (green jackfruit, ground pork, homemade shrimp paste, plum tomato, kaffir lime leaves, cilantro, and scallion, and served with sticky rice and pork rinds), which was really spicy (I ordered it medium) and delicious. My brother got the khao soi (egg noodles in creamy coconut curry topped with crispy noodles) with chicken, which was good. We also shared the kung pare (pan fried crispy baby shrimp cloud cake served with sweet chili sauce), which was so crispy and shrimpy.

But today we wanted Thai food without going into manhattan.  After reading reviews on several places we decided to pop in. First when you go in you see the amazing art murals on opposite sides of the room. It's a very small restaurant, maybe sits 15-20 people. A lovely server told us that we can sit anywhere so we choose a seat by the window. It's right across the street from a park and the subway entrance is right outside the door so you can people watch. The menu looks very enticing but can be intimidating if you've never had authentic Thai food. But luckily it has photos of everything. It took us a bit but we finally ordered: Crab Egg Plam $9grilled scramble eggs with crab meat in banana leavesYum Jin Gai $15flamed hot pot with chicken & herbs in Northern Thai style soup Kang Hung Ley $13tender pork belly, ginger, peanut, pickled garlic with masala curry. served with riceThai iced coffee $3We chatted with the crab egg plam. It was interesting. Strange but interesting. It was exactly what the menu says. Scrambled eggs with crab meat. It did lack spice and tasted a little fishy. I had to ask for hot sauce. She brought over some red chili flakes that were very spicy. That made it more palatable. Then we had the Yum Jin Gai and the Kang Hung Ley. The soup was very cool visually and the flavor profile was delicious. You could taste the floral notes of the flowers. Decent portion too. I ordered the Kang Hung Ley for my meal. I've never had taro or anything with curry in it so I said why not. The dish is beautiful. The pieces of pork were very large and juicy! Now the taro egg nest I didn't care for at all. I don't know if it was supposed to be the way it was but it was fried into a bird nest shape. It was very hard. The hard boiled egg I wouldn't even touch because it looked very strange. The sauce with the curry was interesting. Again I have never had it before. When I asked the server about the masala curry when we were ordering, she said that it was a mixture of the Indian traditional curry and the south East Asian curries. I was intrigued and it turned out pretty good. Now after all of this very long review I have to say that I have marked this restaurant off of my list. It's beautiful, the food is interesting, the service was perfect and the prices were decent. Would I go back? Probably not. Just wasn't a huge wow factor especially when there's so many other places out there to try. Don't let me discouraged you though. It might be amazing to you. Whatever floats your boat you know?"

Just treat it as regular tap water, although it is definitely a good talking point if you're with others.The large Leng Soup is what you want to get as long as you're not weirded out by seeing whole stretches of spine in your soup and separating it vertebrae by vertebrae to get all of the meat. The meat on the bone is oh-so-tender and plentiful. You will be overwhelmed by how much meat there is- it's basically a buffet. The soup is sour and citrusy with a huge kick from all the green chilli. You get two bowls of jasmine rice with the soup, but can easily feed 3, possibly four, with the one dish. The menu says that it is brutally spicy, but keep in mind that you can ask them for a less spicy option if you can't handle it.The Crab Egg Plam was a pretty ordinary hard scrambled egg with crab meat. Probably not something that I'd get again.Abb Ong Oor was a steamed pork brain mixed with shrimp paste and a bunch of other seasonings including chilli and turmeric. It's not too spicy, but it tastes like it has a million spices mixed in. The texture is super creamy from the pork brain, but you don't taste the brain at all. It's so well hidden that I wouldn't have guessed it was in there without having seen the menu beforehand. Get this solely for the novelty, though. It's not something that is going to fill you up, because the amount that you get will be a bit less than the size of your smartphone(excluding the flip phones of the past and the needlessly large Samsung Note-esque devices).The Pink Lady really just tastes like a sour Pad Thai. But it is dissimilar to simply adding lime to pad thai, which results in a sharp sour taste.  This sourness is more mellowed. Really interesting and a great way to switch things up. The Thai Tea Pad Thai is a must try for foodies. I can't say that I'd order it again, but it was a very unique experience. The noodles taste strongly of thai tea. You can say that it's a gimmick and I would totally agree with you, but I recommend you to try it once in your life."

Overall, we were very satisfied with our meal (we ordered several dishes and ate family style). We ordered one of the curry dishes, the lemongrass chicken, a papaya salad and the mango sticky rice for dessert. The curry was amazing...hands down, the sauce was some of the best that I've ever had. And the mango sticky rice was delicious, with a unique take, as there were six different small samples of flavored rice along with the mango.I will say though, that the papaya salad and chicken were average at best. I usually love papaya salad, but their version left much to be desired.I did leave feeling very full and satisfied. If I am in Elmhurst again, I will definitely return if I am in the mood for a curry dish (or if I am feeling like a fat kid and want to binge on some savory sticky rice). I just don't suggest ordering the lemongrass chicken or papaya salad though."

What's great about Lamoon is that their cuisine is from the Northern part, so their dishes are different from what you will usually see at other Thai restaurants.For a table of three people, we over-ordered. Do we regret it? Hell no. We got:- Angie (papaya salad) - standard fare- Khao soi with chicken leg (egg noodles in coconut curry) - one of my friends liked this, I thought it was just ok- Kanon jeen nam ngeaw (vermicelli in pork ribs shrimp paste stew with blood cubes) - had a nice spice to it, I was expecting more but not bad- Leng soup - this was my FAVEEE! It's a subtle sour flavor and spice that hits you (I didn't think it was that spicy though even though the menu said it's brutally spicy) and it comes with a huge pork spine and lots of meat, also lots of chili, scallion and cilantro- Thai tea pad thai - this was interesting; it was sweet and smelled of Thai tea. I'm not sure if I would get it again as it started tasting too sweet as I kept eating it- Kang hung ley (pork belly with curry) - pork was tender and fell apart but I felt the flavors were a bit lackingI would come back to try the other dishes and the leng soup again. Pretty solid establishment and the staff is really nice."

Here is what he suggested:- SAI AUA (Herbal Thai Sausage): To be honest, I had never had a Thai sausage before, but I could be convinced to make them a staple of my future diet based on these fragrant, crispy links filled with lemongrass, kaffir lime leaves, and pork ear- KHAO TOD (Rice Ball): Very similar to the arancini of Italian cuisine, but obviously Thai with curry paste and coconut flakes. Not a must order, but packed with heat and at $1 a certified steal- KANG HUNG LEY: Very tender pork belly with masala curry - solid but not spectacular- THAI TEA PAD THAI: No, that's not a typo. As far as I am aware, the only Thai joint to whip up a Thai tea-infused rice noodle. The flavor is relatively subtle when surrounded by all the wonderful ingredients that constitute a pad thai, but it is certainly there and a must-order- PANANG CURRY: Have you ever come across a sauce so good you just wanted to drink it? If not, you will after getting a taste of this curry. The most amazing mix of sweet, spicy, and umami, I ate this over some jasmine rice and scooped the leftover curry straight into my mouth holeThai food in New York usually evokes the restaurants that dot a long stretch of Ninth Avenue in the Manhattan neighborhood of Hell's Kitchen. However, with a few more spots left to try, I would not be surprised if my vote reverted to Elmhurst as the destination for Thai dining."

My husband ordered it with beef, which was over cooked and tough to chew. The sriracha noodles - I definitely don't think this is 'authentic' Thai, more of a makeshift dish, basically wide ribbon noodles with chicken and egg then doused with sriracha on top. In saying this, I thoroughly enjoyed it. The portion was HUGE, you need 2 people for this one, at $13 (before tax and tip) I was happy. The noodles had that delicious chewiness to them, the sauce clinging and coating the noodles well. Even with the sriracha, the spice was still fairly mild, the chicken was well cooked without being dry. The egg added some additional background texture and flavour too.I've walked passed here a few times and knew it would be a small restaurant but upon actually entering, it was obvious they've tried to cram too many tables in such a small space making it very awkward to sit down and for other diners squeezing in and out from the table next to you. Nonetheless, this place is fairly popular and gets fairly busy. Not family friendly for those with a large group or small children/babies, you're definitely not getting a stroller in here without drawing attention to yourself. No restrooms either.Pricing is slightly more expensive than other Thai restaurants (2 mains with tax and tip is about $35) though they have a very extensive menu featuring some dishes that I haven't seen at other Thai places. The decor is quite colourful, Thai street art inspired but not as vibrant and modern as it looks in the restaurant's advertised pictures. The staff are very attentive and the wait times for your food isn't too bad at 15-20 minutes. Originally, I anticipated the portion sizes to be on the small side (from how it appeared in the menu), however they are VERY servings.All in all, a decent Thai restaurant to visit if you're in the area. A few doors down you'll find a Thai/hainanese place doing steamed chicken and rice, another doing few varieties of crispy pork dishes....then ANOTHER standard Thai restaurant. Yu Tea is there too in between them all. You've really got a lot of variety on this one block, take you're pick! :D"

This underappreciated charmer serves Asian-infused cuisine you don't normally find at most Thai places. For me personally, this isn't necessarily my type of food. But that doesn't mean I can't recognize what a culinary and delicious option this is for foodies and fans of this culinary fare.Lamoon is a very small restaurant. But it doesn't really feel that way. With it's bright colors and big windows, it's a very comfortable space to dine. Being small and cozy, the service is stellar and attentive. The menu is inviting and extensive, with colorful photos and descriptions that definitely gets you wanting to try a little bit of everything. The menu is full of what they call Lanna dishes, inspired by the ancient Lanna Kingdom, also known as ""a Million Rice Fields.""  Popular in the 13th-18th centuries, Lanna food is less sweet but more spicy and savory by using herbal ingredients, such as lemongrass, kaffir lime leaves, and onion. The Northern Thai cuisine mainly uses pork and components that easily found locally, which cannot found in the regular Central Thai cooking. It also uses a variety of organic vegetables and fresh herbs.We started out with the Crab Egg Plam, grilled scramble eggs with crab meat in banana leaves.Then we had the Kang Hung Ley, tender pork belly, ginger, peanut, pickled garlic with masala curry. I'm not a curry fan, but OMG, this was delicious. The pork belly was mouthwatering. The sauce was perfect.We then had the Yum Jin Gai, which is their flamed hot pot with chicken & herbs in Northern Thai style soup. This wasn't my favorite. There were pieces of skin and fat. And, I'm not a fan of Thai soup. But, for those who like this kind of flavor, it's a definite.It was a lovely night. I don't know if we'll be back, only because it's not my kind of fare. But if it's yours, it's definitely worth checking out."

I had just spent a week traveling around Thailand and was craving more northern Thai specialties. This place didn't disappoint. The tom yum noodle soup and khao soi were both on point. Staff were friendly and explained to all the diners how they traditionally eat each dish in Thailand (i.e. mixing mustard greens and shallots into the khao soi). The chicken wings were unfortunately pretty greasy (even sitting in a puddle of grease when served), but that didn't change the fact that they were piping hot and tasty. If only it didn't take me 75 minutes on the subway to get here I'd be a regular, because there's so much else on the menu that I'd want to try, like the Leng soup, ""BRUTALLY SPICY"" pork spine broth with a metric buttload of chilis."

Thai food. Hands down favorite Thai restaurant in NYC right now. So long I wondered when real Northern Thai cuisine would arrive stateside and maybe the time wasn't right until now, maybe NYC wasn't ready for it before...but baby, we're doubtless ready for it now. Came here twice so far, and excited to go back again soon. If you're a fan of SE Asian cuisine (hint: sweet, spicy, sour--all together) and enjoy eating at authentic restaurants in Asia, you can't order wrong, everything here is good. Beautiful presentations too. First time I tried: 1) mango salad with ant eggs: kinda like a papaya salad, but with mango, so a bit more of the sweet mixed with the tanginess of the vinegar and spiciness of the peppers. The ant eggs look like little white beans, and taste pretty bland, like tiny steamed edamame that has a little snap when you bite it. 2) Khao soi with chicken: creamy coconut-based curry. Tender chicken, generous portions. Noodles in the sauce, topped with the same noodles deep fried. Great textural contrasts. 3) Kang Hung Lay: Thai style pork belly stew...super tender and savory, ginger and soy in the broth along with a number of other spices. Topped with taro chips. My friend practically wanted to pick up the plate and lick it clean. 4) mango sticky rice: one of the best versions of this desert I've had outside of Thailand. Second time:1) Khao soi beef: I didn't think it could get better than the chicken version but boy was I wrong. So tender...2) jackfruit salad with deep fried pork rinds on the side. A heartier salad, this is has multiple textures and a both fresh and earthy flavor. Might not be for everyone but my one friend loooved it. The pork rinds added a nice crunch. 3) shrimp pad Thai: ordered by a less adventurous friend, this was surprising in a delicious way, the flavors aren't your normal pad Thai, they use a bit of Thai tea in their noodles, so they are a little on the sweeter side, but very tasty. 4) herbal chicken hot pot: savory, sour and spicy like they do it in Thailand. Not for the faint of heart. If you can eat a tablespoonful of sriracha and be okay with that level of spice, then please try this soup. My mouth was burning but I still ate/drank all of this. Btw, they don't serve mango sticky rice if they don't have ripe mangos, andAND they serve water flavored with pandan leaves, a fragrant plant used to flavor many SE Asian desserts--not sweet, but provides a fine fragrance to the water. Friendly servers and owner checked in on us periodically when we were eating both times, even when it was packed. Keep up the great hospitality!"

When I saw Lamoon featured in a NY Times article, I had to go with my Bangkok travel buddy.Lamoon is conveniently located right off the Elmhurst Ave. stop - so close that we actually walked right past it. We were seated immediately on a Wednesday night and I instantly fell in love with the thoughtful, beautifully blue decor. Customer service was great, but on to the food! + Pandan water (complimentary) - I was going to order a Thai iced tea until I had a sip of this. I LOVE pandan - like, I'm a total sucker for anything pandan - and this was absolutely perfect. The pandan came through strong and fragrant, but not too grassy. It was addictingly refreshing and an excellent complement to the rich food we got. + Khao soy with tofu ($13) - Who needs meat when a vegetarian dish can be THIS good? The tofu was prepared as one of my favorite renditions - puffy and airy with a crispy (though not after being soaked in the soup) exterior. The airiness soaks up the khao soy perfectly. The flavor of the khao soy was phenomenal - rich, intense, totally addicting with layers of flavor. Even though this was primarily my friend's entree, I couldn't help sneaking more spoonfuls. + Thai tea pad thai with chicken ($13) - Not sure if this is traditional; I've never seen pad thai made with tea but I loved it. The tea made the noodles a bright orange color and added a subtle layer of tea flavor, which really lightened the dish. The chicken was great, but I think I would get the tofu next time. Totally recommend this. The portions are large; I ended up taking half of my food home, though I probably should have stopped after half. It was an excellent meal and I would absolutely come back. Also my favorite dessert chain from Hong Kong (Hui Lau Shan) just opened down the street, so it was a perfect pairing :) The mango sticky rice here looked amazing - with rainbow colored rice, just like in Bangkok - but I was in the mood for something lighter."

The restaurant has a minimalist designed and I really like the cloud decorated shades hanging on the ceiling, which gave it a simple, yet relaxing vibe.The service was also great and our server always made sure to fill our water to the top so we don't have to keep on asking. However, food wise, I can't say I'm a huge fan. Our soup was tasty but when it came out it was lukewarm. Also the portion overall was more like tapas size, which I was a bit surprised considering the price tag that came along with it. Taste wise, I had better. Our filet tamarind fish was way too sweet and they only gave one fish filet for this dish was really small considering they chard $13 for that dish. Also their fermented pork rib ($10) is was not actual ribs but instead they used rib tips, which made the pork taste dry and chewy. We also had their Khao Soi Chicken ($13), and flavor wise, it was just bland. Overall, I'm glad I came here to check this restaurant out but I'm not sure if it's one that I would recommend to my friends if they ask.Ooh and one more thing, the benches they used as seats were not comfortable at all. It was hard and just annoying to get up and down from."

I got to try the Thai tea pad Thai noodles and I didn't taste the Thai tea in the noodles, but I must say the noodles were cooked extremely well. I'm still craving it now as I type up this review. I also tried the egg wrap fried rice and the menu pic is a bit deceiving. The rice is not actually wrapped with a full blanket of egg. However, the portion size is much bigger than pictured so it made up for it! Enjoyed both entrees and the Thai iced tea as well!

It tasted like pretty standard pad thai to me but less sweet for sure...mmm more sour? I'm not sure what the taste is but it was good! The crushed peanuts added a nice touch to it. Pretty filling too.The khao tod was nicely seasoned. Couldn't quite pinpoint what the exact spices were though.Nice experience of what Northern Thai food is like!

I find Lamoon unique even among only the Northern Thai places in NY. I've been to most of them by now and the cuisine is being better represented nowadays.  Lamoon and one or two others are leading the charge. Even their water is pandan flavored. Expect authenticity here.There are two dishes that I feel are a must get: the Sai Aua (signature Herbal Thai sausage) and the Leng soup. Their sausage is unique. Kaffir lime leaves and lemongrass pops in your mouth as soon as you bite into it.  The Leng soup is a like a beast that needs to be tamed. You have to approach it with caution. I think people can get intimated by the description in the menu because it says BRUTALLY SPICY - yes, in caps, on the menu.  I found it a lot easier to handle if you take your time with it. The heat comes in waves and it's a slow burner that doesn't interfere with the wonderful sour notes in between. The broth is really flavorful and you really can't go wrong with pork spine in a delicious broth.I saw khao soi on the menu and I had to get it. However, this is the first time I have tried this dish in all of North America that hit the mark for me.  Crispy noodles, flat soft noodles, an amazing coconut curry broth, a stupendously large piece of chicken leg and a side of pickled lettuce and shallots which I just threw into my curry (because I like to live dangerously). I don't  think you will find a better khao soi in NY and if you do, please drop me a note.The Abb Ong Oor is just your daily steamed marinated pork brain. If you are squeamish about this type of stuff, probably better to stay away but I grew up eating brain masala so this was comfort food at some level. However if you are feeling adventurous, the addition of shrimp paste and herbs should ease your induction into the glorious world of brain gastronomy. Good luck.The larb neua didn't taste like any other larb I've had before because the flavor was more earthy but this was top notch as well. In addition to the ground pork, it comes with bits of liver and belly. Pork is king here."

I was so wrong. I actually have never tried Northern Thai food here in the States. Pretty much all Thai places have the same things - pad thai, pad kee mao... but this one is different. I highly recommend the Northern Thai Pork Blood Soup and Jor Pak Kad for share - both made with flavorful and hearty pork broth, one with pork meatballs and blood cubes and the other with ribs. Their signature Chili Pork Sausage is spicy and just okayish. I love the Fillet Tamarind Fish!! The fillet is battered fried and crunchy in sweet and sour sauce with lots of fried onion and garnished with pomegranate seeds. It comes great with rice. Also recommend the Kanom Jeen Nam Ngeaw which is rice vermicelli noodle with ribs in shrimp paste and tomato broth. It's sour and spicy, very flavorful. For dessert I tried their colorful sticky rice with pumpkin custard because they ran out of mango that day. Nothing special. Staff is very friendly and attentive. Price is reasonable. The only minus is probably they only have employee restroom, which they will let you use if you ask."

The mango was very fresh, but I thought the rice balls would've been better if they were a little less sweet. The different colors are different flavors but it's a subtle difference. It was interesting. The brown is coffee, the green is matcha, the red is Thai tea, the blue is butterfly pea, the yellow is gardenia flower, and the white is coconut. Overall a good place to chill.

The staff were so friendly and helpful in talking about the food. They add pandan to the water--which is delicious. We ended up trying the fermented pork, Hanam Kadook Moo. It was so tender and packed in so much flavor. We also had the Yum Jin Gai, the herbal chicken soup. This had a ton of delicate flavor and was a little spicy but not too hot. Then we had the Kang Hoh, which is a glass noodle dish with pork. The pork is a little sweeter and there were some bits of sour in the vegetables. It played nicely with the spicier soup. For dessert we had the floating lotus, which anyone who likes cream top and tapioca pearls will like!We loved this place and definitely will come back! It's really special."

The restaurant was smaller than expected, but very cutesy. I got the Northern Red Curry while my girlfriend got Pad Kee Mao. Wow man, the red curry was so delicious after one taste of it that I was actually in shock. It was amazing. I didn't really know how the jackfruit and grapes would add in to the curry, but it was such a unique sweet and savory taste and I couldn't stop eating it. The pad kee mao was also exquisite, it wasn't as salty and oily as a lot of places make it, but it still retained a rich flavor. The food at this place actually WOWed me, MUST come back."

This one was another great find. I mainly came for the leng soup (tangy, sour, pork bone soup adorned with a lot of green onions and herbs). Even the small portion is big enough to share among two people. The Thai tea pad thai was made with coconut milk and was very fragrant. I'm not sure if they used tamarind to make this version, but it definitely captured the creaminess of thai tea somehow. The deep fried baby shrimp takes 20 min to make so take that into consideration if you're in a rush. Not much of a pancake, it was fried to a crisp. It stayed crispy for days in the fridge. I'm glad we tried this place, there's lots of stuff that I wish I tried on the menu. Will come again! Friendly staff too!"

Was more than impressed by the--not spicy--pork blood soup with an ever so slightly sweet aromatic broth, tender pork, liver, pork balls, sprouts, green onions and herbs, with plenty of perfectly cooked rice vermicelli--egg noodles are also an option. Note that this noodle dish is not on the web site menu, along with a number of other non spicy and spicy ones. The printed menu also has spiciness ratings. Also had the ever so slightly spicy rice ball: crunchy on the outside and coconut and herb creamy within. Cute tiny place with Thai pop and rap music. If you take the M or R from Manhattan, get off the back and you'll be right there. Will definitely be back!"

It's a small but very clean and modern looking dining area.  I ordered from the lunch special menu which consisted of an appetizer and main course. I chose the rice balls as an appetizer and they were amazingly delicious and very fulfilling. For the main course I had the chicken fried rice with chili sauce which was spicy and yummy.  I also ordered the Thai iced tea which was just Ok, I've had tastier versions. The prices were fair and the menu items were a lot different from your typical Thai spot. I would definitely check them out again when I am in the area."

When the Portlandia theme-song came on, very loudly, my friend and I laughed at one another: where are we? This spot used to be Ploy Thai, which advertised itself as BYOB, but just as soon as my friend and I opened our beers, a couple of police officers (seeing us through the windows) came inside the restaurant and gave us tickets, because BYOB is illegal in Queens. So I may hold a bit of a grudge. All of the above would have been meaningless had only the food been good. But--just the beginning--the menu listed ""oysters with your choice of meat,"" we chose pork, and what we got was maybe 2 ounces of pork in 2 ounces of oyster sauce! I love Thai oyster sauce, but this dish felt like a robbery, even if it had come with oysters, it was so skimpy! And then there were the overcooked clumpy dry noodles that we ordered with tofu that tasted like it just came out of the container, it had zero flavor. But I guess the Kao Soi had some positive qualities, namely that there was nothing wrong with it, but it definitely wasn't remarkable or outstanding at all... I'm not going into detail about the forgetful waitress but we had every intention of coming back again tomorrow evening as well until we actually ate here."

I really want to try this place since they open because its just in my neighborhood and I'm glad they have a delivery through yelp. We got thai iced tea for our drinks and it was a little to sweet. For appetizer we got the crispy papaya salad with shrimp and squid. Wow! Amazing. Its my first time to try crispy papaya and surprisingly it taste really good. The sauce is great too. For food I got the jor pak kad- its pork soup with vegestable. Its perfect! Very good for cold weather and you can match it with rice. Taste so delicious and similar to one of our filipino soup dish. My bf got the kung hung ley- pork belly with ginger, peanut and masala curry served with rice on the side. My bf really like it. Pork is tender and sauce is tasty. We both agreed that the food was great and we can't wait to dine in! Yum!"

I hope this is how situations are handled during the conflict.  Ordered some delivery from here. Food wasn't bad decent flavors. However, they didn't provide the Thai iced tea that I ordered. Which is honestly not that big of deal. My real issue is how they handled the situation.We called and said we ordered but didn't get our Thai ice tea. He insisted that we didn't order it, so I thought maybe I didn't and ended the call.Then I checked my receipt in my email and it's clearly there so I called back. He argued for about two minutes saying we didn't order it. When I'm looking at it on my order/receipt. Then he said let me get my manager. They then came back and said we'll remember you next time and give it to you. I asked how would they remember and he said idk maybe you can do something in the app. Wut?? He never said sorry or offered anything else. First off don't say I didn't order something when I did. Second don't argue with me when I have proof. Third say sorry and come up with better sol. Also take Accountability of mistakes. A simple ""sorry we missed that do you want a refund?"" Would have sufficed I honestly would've just said no it's fine but thanks for offering. But NAH argue and say I didn't order it."

The Thai ice tea and chrysanthemum drink were good. The waiter were friendly. The environment was fun. Lots of art on the wall, plants near the window, lights hanging and the greece colors. The blue and white colors made this place feel comforting. Northern Thai food is good. Wish they can take credit card and not just cash. Hope they change that for my next visit."

Finally I got that chance & Lamoon surely didn't disappoint!Lamoon brings all the brilliant flavors of northern Thailand in this casual hipster joint. From beginning to end, the taste of the dishes were amazing! I ordered the kao soi while my friend had the tea flavored pad thai. Deliciousness in every bite without the flavors being too sweet or salty. We also ordered the fried baby shrimp pancake & mango sticky rice to share. I know, overkill for 2 people but we had to try it all! Needless to say, we left stuffed, happily satisfied.I will definitely be coming back regularly to this neighborhood joint.

It might just take over as my new favorite Thai place in Elmhurst knocking my old favorite Boon Chu (which is only a few blocks away) off my radar.Here is a few reasons why:-Vibrant aesthetics upon entering - loved their hanging ""lanterns"". It is a small space with limited tables but very comfortable homey vibes.-Service was very attentive. The owner personally took our order and gave us some recommendations and suggestions on the menu options.-BEST I EVER HAD OUTSIDE OF THAILAND - not even exaggerating. I do not know what northern thai cuisine is like but now I know. Ever since I came back from my Thailand trip in 2015. I wasn't able to find any true authentic Thai restaurant that gave me the same level of spice and kick to my tastebuds. My palate seemed to have change to a higher level of spice tolerance and all of the other Thai restaurants I've tried can no longer satisfied what I was truly seeking - that fiery kick - and I found it at Lamoon Thai!We started off with the Yum Jin Gai which was the spicy thai herbal chicken and banana blossom soup! The soup was so hearty and packed with chicken (both dark and white meat)! It was a perfect warm me up soup for a cold winter day! Bonus feature- it came out in a flamed hot pot that kept the soup hot for the duration of at least 10 mins.I really liked the Jackfruit salad with the sticky rice and fried pork rinds - the jackfruit salad was so aromatic and the perfect spice level for me !! The pork rinds added a nice crunch for texture and the sticky rice paired so well to balance off the spice of the salad itself. Another dish that I found super interesting was the Thai Tea infused pad Thai ! It's a must try. I was hesitant at first because pad thai is super basic dish that you can get anywhere and I didn't think I would find it any different from other places and boy was I wrong. It was a pleasant surprise because the noodles came out bright orange like the Thai iced tea color and tasted just like Thai iced tea. I was mind blown by how they actually incorporated the Thai tea flavor into the noodles.Not only did they pay close attention to details with regards to the taste of their dishes, the creativity of the presentation is unique in its own. From the banana leaves to butterfly pea flowers, goes to show how simplicity can take things to the next level. The Le Neptune Dessert was so fun to assemble, color changing water jelly using butterfly pea flower tea as you break into the jelly shifts the color from blue to light purple, add in another burst of color from the mango nectar and raspberry sorbet. It's an art canvas in dessert form.Can't you tell how obsessed I am already ? Go visit! Your belly will thank you later!"

My favorite dish was actually a mango with a sweet and salty shrimp sauce. It kind of tasted like a sweet and salty honey but I really enjoyed this dish and hopes to bring some more home. I also had their Thai tea pad thai which was really good I could only taste a little bit of Thai tea though. Some other dishes we ordered was a fish based tamarind dish, blue coconut water, and the mango sticky rice flight set. I'm really excited to go back to this restaurant to try more dishes."

Another dish we had was jackfruit salad that came with sticky rice and fried pork grind. I want to say if the food wasn't so spicy I would have enjoyed them a lot more. But hey whose fault was it? I asked for spicy so I got what I wanted...The service was super quick and our servers were nice and provided accurate information."

It was a refreshing change from the old Thai restaurant that took up the space years ago. It was much brighter and welcoming. It's a small space but they manage to pack people in comfortably. Upon sitting the staff let us know that if we checked in on yelp (only applicable on certain weekday dates I believe; not applicable on weekends from what I remember) we can get a free Thai Iced Tea or chrysanthemum tea. A very nice gesture. The menu has a variety of things to try. The Kanom Jeen Nam Ngeaw (vermicelli with pork ribs, tomato, pig blood cubes  in soup) was nice and flavorful. The pork ribs fell off the bone. The soup had a nice fragrant flavor and heat that sneaks up on you. The Yum Jin Gai (flamed hot pot with chicken, banana blossom, coriander in spicy herbal soup) is the Thai version of a chicken soup with HEAT! LOVED!! It came with chunks of chicken. But was nice and refreshing  because of the coriander and lemongrass.  We had some leftover and brought it home. The next day it was even better!!! Be prepared to sweat though!!The Larb Nena was another well executed dish. It packed a lotta heat but was so good that we kept eating it and by the time we finished that fish, my entire mouth needed to be hosed down by the FDNY. Staff was super friendly and accommodating. We will def be coming back to the try the other stuff soon!!"

The sai oua (herbaceous grilled pork sausage, redolent of fragrant, aromatic lemongrass, makrut limes perhaps galangal?) and leng soup have stayed in my mind for days, even weeks, after eating them. The leng soup is especially arresting: a shock of pork neck or spine in a pool of collagen-rich broth, and showered with finely-chopped herbs. The vegetarian at our table broke rank and proclaimed it a highlight of our meal.But there were so many highlights - the nam phrik ong should be served in a trough. The jackfruit was unexpectedly meaty and spicy. The ""brutally spicy"" leng soup was anything but, despite my earnest plea for a ""Thai spicy"" bowl, but this was for the better. Everyone got to enjoy it, and we left Lamoon for Broadway's night-time thrum sated and blissfully.P.S.: Lamoon, if you're reading this, please publish a cookbook."

My friends and I ordered the Som Tum Thai (not spicy or tangy enough for me), Khao Soi with chicken (seemed to be lacking a certain punch) and Thai tea pad Thai (good but nothing to write home about). I think that the food here was decent but definitely not to the standard of Ayada, Khao Kang or Chao Thai in the surrounding area. The clientele of the restaurant also does not seem to include as many Thai people as the aforementioned restaurants either which leads me to wonder if the food has been toned down to suit American tastes."

It's definitely a cute little spot and they also have a bathroom in the back just in case you're wondering since you won't see it when you walk in.The water they give looks like water but it's actually pandan water! Interestingggggg! Also, our server was super nice.For an appetizer, we ordered:Hnam Kadook Moo: grandpa recipe homemade fried fermented pork ribs- Loved how crispy it was on the outside and it was pretty garlicky but I felt like there was flavor missing. Maybe cause it's not a lot of meat around the bone so it was a little more on the dry side.Entrees:Chicken Khao Soi: egg noodle in creamy coconut curry topped with crispy noodle. Comes with shallots, lime slice & pickled cabbage on the side- The chicken was fall of the bone good! Loved the creamy coconut which was a little more on the sweeter side. And obv love anything crispy so the crispy noodles on top were a plus. Overall good flavor!Thai Tea Pad Thai: Thai tea infused rice noodle sauté with tamarind juice, sweet turnip, black tofu, ground nut, beansprout, dried shrimp flake & topped with splash of coconut milk (I got it with shrimp)- The noodles are actually orange and really do taste like thai tea. Very interesting concept but it was good! I feel like the overall flavor isn't too strong so it doesn't overpower the thai tea noodles. Liked that there were lots of pieces with shrimp.Overall, I felt like the food at Lamoon was good! It didn't blow me away and I'd def come back to try other dishes on the menu but also don't need to go back lol. TLDR; Chicken Khao Soi!"

They let you know ahead of time but this dish does take like 15 minutes to make. The dish is something I had when I was a kid and it was good. It was nice and crispy and it was a pretty large order. I enjoyed this dish but the dish did come out a little too crunchy, like shrimp pieces were flying everywhere when I cut into it lol These also pair with with a sweet chili sauce which was nice. yelp.com/user_local_phot…Khao Soi Chicken- Egg noodles with chicken in creamy coconut curry topped with crispy noodles with a side of shallots, lime and pickled lettuce. They offer the option to do chicken leg or chicken breast but I feel you should order it the way they do it in Thailand which is the chicken leg. The flavor on this was great and I really like how they have the boiled yellow noodle as well as a crispy noodle on top. I enjoyed this dish but this dish came off spicy and this dish is typically not. I also enjoyed how tender and juicy the chicken was and I really liked the pickled lettuce that came with it, the pickled lettuce offer a nice counter to the savory and rich broth. yelp.com/user_local_phot…Sai Aua(100 grams of herbal Thai sausage)- Ground pork with chili paste, kaffir leaves, lemongrass, cilantro & pork ear. I enjoyed these, they tasted like the traditional Thai fish cake called Tod Mun but this one had pig ear which offered a really great crunch. This is a something to try. yelp.com/user_local_phot…Kang Hung Ley- Tender pork belly, ginger, peanut, pickled garlic with masala curry served with rice.

Curry was average with the soup base being more watery than i liked, but maybe thats the style of curry, mango salad was okay enjoyed the sweet with the savory kick of the fish sauce mixed into it, but again nothing about it screamed out to me. mango sticky rice was cute but again uninteresting and uninspiring.........with so many thai food options around the elmhurst area, the asian fushion joint that is lamoon is probably the least impression"

I love checking out the growing amount of Southeast Asian spots run by Southeast Asian immigrants and their descendants. I'm a fan of mainstream Thai food, but it's nice to see restaurants trying to showcase Thai food from different regions.My brother and I got the Thai tea pad thai, the kang hung ley, sai aua, rainbow sticky rice, kung pare, and a khao tod (rice ball) to share. The khao tod was interesting but not particularly remarkable, and the sai aua had a strong, somewhat acquired taste that neither my brother nor I loved. We did love the kang hung ley, which is a tender pork belly with ginger, peanut, pickled garlic, with masala curry. When I think and dream of pork belly, it looks something like this. I loved the kung pare, which reminded me (and my parents who tried our leftovers later) of a Filipino dish called okoy, but like a distant cousin/relative of that dish. It was really big and basically a bunch of tiny fried shrimps and batter. I'm a fan, but my brother didn't love it as much. He did love the thai tea pad thai, which was good and surprisingly the Thai tea taste really went through.The rainbow sticky rice was a perfect way to end the meal. The different colors actually have different flavors you can taste - coconut, Thai coffee, butterfly pea, Thai tea, jackfruit, and matcha. Delicious, and something you should definitely get no matter what you choose for your main courses. Even though we didn't love everything we got, I did love a lot of what I got and the vibe of the place. There's a lot of other things I want to try on the menu. The service was also great, as was the art on the wall."

If you're torn between two fried rice providers, go with this one. Normally it takes me a few days to get it together and compile my notes for a comprehensive Yelp review, but I felt tonight that it would be an ethical issue if I didn't write a glowing review in real time:First of all, I have never found a fried rice that upon delivery has been able to maintain its integrity and flavor. Luckily, Lamoon spared me the floppy vegetables and soggy rice. Whoever made this is on top of his or her game.I ordered the ""Fried Rice Nam Prik Ong,"" which is fried rice with homemade plum tomato chili paste. The vegetables, especially the broccoli stalks, were crisp and firm, and I have never even tasted a fried rice this delicious on site. Anywhere in New York. I would also like to thank the kitchen staff for accommodating my request to prepare it ""as spicy as possible.""I walk by this restaurant all the time, and the venue looks beautifully conceived as well as clean and prosperous. I look forward to sitting down and supplementing my next savory experience with the ""Floating Lotus"" organic tapioca trio."

They have such a beautiful interior with a huge mural on the walls. The space isn't that big. They have a huge wooden communal tables that's really pretty with a bunch of other seating on the side. The day I came in there was 2 added make shift tables in the back which is where I sat. The place was crowded so I'm pretty sure these tables for just a last resort because they were the kind of tables you have in your backyard for a BBQ but you cover up with a table cover because it's not the prettiest.For the menus it was on a clipboard and looked pretty used since they were just using normal paper so some of the menus were folded or dirty. I started off with their Thai Ice Tea which was really good! My group ordered a bunch of stuff to try and sample everything. We ordered their Mango Salad, Nam Prik Ong, Nam Prik Ong Fried Rice, and Khao Soi. All the dishes were fairly big and easy to share. The mango salad I thought was a little tart but I loved the crispy anchovies they put on it! There was a little too much sauce on it but it was a good starter to have. Their Nam Prik Ong which I used to make lettuce wraps out of I thought were a little too salty. It helps that it came with rice to tone down the saltiness. The best part was the Khao Soi! I recently found out about this dish about a year ago and it's my favorite Thai dish! I love the crispiness of the noodles. For meat I was kind of hoping for more but it was a good amount with the noodles you get. The service was really quick and I could see myself coming here more. It's especially easy because the train station is right outside! It's such a convenient location. I saw they have a good amount of lunch specials too which I would probably do to avoid the dinner rush."

I walked by this place seeing the nyt articles about this place hanging on the wall a few times and finally I walked in! The interior is very pretty, blue and while tone makes u feel like close to the ocean/nature.I tried the 3rd thing on the special menu, I forgot the name but it has pork chops and blood curd in the noodle soup. Very tomato-ish flavor with a little luck of spicy. And the noodles are well cooked and soaked with the soup which is exactly the way I liked it! For apps we got crab egg palm. The omelette is served with palm leaves and u can taste the palm tree with the eggs. It's a special flavor and definitely worth trying. Also heard good things about coconut drink and rainbow mango sticky rice dessert. Need to come back."

I only came here because I saw that they had a good review but no, this place is a trap. I don't know how this place has almost five stars on yelp. As for the dining experience bring your jackets and layer up as there is no heat despite the staff claiming that it's on. We were then sat next to the portable heater at a foldable table... I didn't come to a restaurant to be seated at a FOLDABLE TABLE... This also created a very awkward vibe as the table is 4 feet next to the staffers (we were the only ones.) The plates were all scratched up and dirty. We ordered the lemon grass chicken wing appetizers and I'm not sure if it's lemongrass or the chicken hasn't been plucked. The water is definitely not clean or the ice machine hasn't been cleaned as there is a noticeable flavor to it. My bf ordered the pad see ew and he's never had a pad see ew with boba/tapioca bubbles in it. And I got the panang curry and I only had two bites and I was done. The chicken was super hard to chew, it was rubbery and had a fishy taste to it. This whole experience was disappointing and we felt very uncomfortable."

Host came quick, talked to us with his big smile and carried the nice attitude all the way. Northern Thai cuisine seem to have slightly different flavor compare to the Thai I'm used to here. Less salty and more sourness I would say.Ordered the Thai Tea Pad Thai and was mentally ready to suffer. End up it does taste sweet, but Lamoon had it balanced pretty well.

The former had a good zest to it and the meat was juicy. The rice-balls were done perfectly: crunchy on the outside and softer on the inside. Not sure what herbs were added, but I could probably eat a bucket of them :)Then for the main course, we've had the khao soi beef, glass noodles, and nam prik ong fried rice. Everything was delicious! Be sure to denote how spicy you'd like it to be though! I have a very low spice tolerance so mild was a bit spicer than expected.Their Thai iced tea was just right and the pea flower tea is as delicious/refreshing as it is pretty. We also indulged in dessert (rainbow sticky rice) and it, too, was tasty.SERVICEEveryone that we met was super nice and helpful.

I didn't recognize a lot of the names of dishes offered but the ingredients and execution are authentic Thai. Did not bother with Thai tea pad Thai because I like authentic pad Thai (actually prefer the egg wrapped kind). You won't see generic dishes you normally see in Manhattan (like green curry and drunken noodles) but this is an excellent choice to try Thailand's many other good eats. The rainbow sticky coconut rice and mango was ok. I would go elsewhere for dessert. Savory items are excellent"

The restaurant is very very small. The restroom is through the kitchen. Not every restaurant is for everyone and everyone knows this. We ordered:1. Kang Hoh-glass noodle with marsala curry with assorted vegetables and peanut, served with rice. $112. Kang Hung Ley-tender pork belly, ginger slivers, peanut, pickled garlic, with masala curry served with rice. $123. Khao Soi-with a drumstick served with egg noodle in coconut curry with the crispy noodles on the side. Garnishes included raw shallot, lime and pickled lettuce. $124. Rainbow sticky rice with mango $9From all the restaurant experiences in my life, the portions at Lamoon were small for the price. Maybe I am too used to other Asian places that serve much larger portions for smaller prices but for $12 a dish I did expect to leave full and we were not. We were still hungry afterwards. For $11 I thought my friend's dish, Khao Soi, would have at least two drumsticks. Drumsticks are so cheap but she only got one. I saw drumsticks at the store today for under 60 cents a pound. My friend also mentioned it was not hot in the center of the drumstick. She felt it was cold inside. The flavors in my opinon were very muted, dull and unremarkable. Personally I was not wow'ed by anything at Lamoon. As a warning, there was a large portion of the menu that my entire table could not eat. We are all allergic to crustaceans. Being allergic to shellfish is super common, allergies to crustaceans even more common. 90% of the menu had shrimp or shrimp paste. We went to another thai place a few days later in Corona, paid under $30 and we got 5 filling meals from the order. I had leftovers for lunch for days. At Lamoon we spent near $60 and three of us were still hungry afterwards. As I said, everyone has different taste and requirements from eating out. Personally if I want Thai, Lamoon would never be a choice for me again. I rather go to Corona to my regular Thai place where I pay $10-$20 and it feeds two people until we are full with leftovers and the flavors are much more yummy and stronger."

With sticky rice it's heaven. lmaoYum Jin Gai is an offer that you can refuse. sounds like a godfather but it's true. You can't resist the scent from number of herbals they put its in.

We've broken up with Grubhub, but Lamoon, you've earned yourselves loyal regulars. Foodwise, we love the Khao Soi-really rich silky broth and tender, flavorful chicken. Also LOVE LOVE LOVE the mango with fish sauce appetizer (very similar to Filipino green mango with bagoong from back home!)

Enter...Lamoon! In some ways, its northern Thai menu is even more authentic and diverse than places you'll find in Bangkok. Ingredients like ant eggs and pig brain and the fact that they don't ask you for your spice level should speak to their unrelenting commitment to authenticity... Although they are relatively new so hopefully they won't give in?!We ordered takeout, but everything (including fried chicken wings and the pork skin) defied physics and was still crispy when we got it! Some standouts were definitely the Kang Hoh (pork belly with glass noodle) and the Jack fruit salad that came with the best sticky rice I've ever had.So... If you're looking for a ""Thai"" restaurant that serves calamari and Thai ice tea cocktails I would look elsewhere. But if you want your mind to be blown by authentic Thai food and all its exciting flavors, definitely pay Lamoon a visit--just please don't complain about the spice level."

Their menu is like no other Thai place that I've ever been to.  It is very unique. The food is absolutely authentic and flavorful. This is coming from someone who lived in Thailand for 2 years. The only complain I have is they took quite a while to bring out the food.Advice to management: I would change the storefront sign and make it bigger and interesting because I always drive past the palace and didn't notice it was there for a long time. I don't want you guys to go out of business because I like your food  and I want to come back for more.

So blown away. I've never been inclined to write a review until now. I went during lunch hours which had a lunch special for $10 that included an appetizer and an entree. The best thing hands down was the northern style soup. The ribs just melted off and the soup was rich, sweet and overall a heck lot of deliciousness.If you're ever down to go an inch out of your comfort zone with Thai food, this is the place to go. It's authentic, affordable and as far as I can tell, there's nothing else like it here in NYC."

So today I gave it a try, I ordered Angie(green papaya salad), its fried green papaya salad, flour covered the green papaya, and absorbed the sauce into its. Perfext combination between crisp n juicy.YummmSecond is the Kung-Pare. The baby shrimp cloud cake. Its huge and looks like a cloud. I recommended strongly!Third is the kangaroo hung key, it's very popular , I formed by the server. The atmosphere is quiet nice and different from the other places around this area. I was so full! Three of us with 2 appetizers n 1 main dish. About $35 for whole meal with this price its steal.I definitely come back again to try. The rainbow sticky rice with mango."

Lol. I like spicy food, and their LARB NUEA is very tastyone. Its perfect combination of great spiciness and herbal flavor together. Not very spicy as my standard but luv it. Kanom jeen nam ngeaw is a must. The flavor of herbal stuffs they put in n red cotton flower imported from thailand will make u fly in the air. Lol#2Fried rice nam prik noom was a great too. Without interuptation from any veggies it represented the green chili flavor 100%. Sadly numbers of restaurants that i visited, they felt customer may not like fried rice with chili paste so they mixed with scallion r tomato, that ruined the chili flavor. Understand? Lol#3Baby shrimp cloud cake is crazy atomic crispy n tasty, like in thailand but it takes like 15 mins for tgis order, which longer than in thailand. Lol#4Obviously will come back again for anothrr meal."

The texture of the chicken was very moist.  The filet was fried perfectly.I will most likely try Lamoon again given that the service was very good however I may wait a bit before doing so."

Me and my friends passed by prior to opening and thought it was a cafe as the decorations were very cute and different from most Thai restaurants we have been to.There are many Thai restaurants in this area but not many that are specified to northern Thai food.Must say that the service was definitely A+! The staff was so attentive. It's a pretty small restaurant so there's limited seating and as its a pretty new restaurant and being a weekday me and my party were seated pretty quickly.Had the Kang hung leung (brasied pork belly) and the Khao soi (egg noodles in creamy curry). The food was not spicy so that was a little different from hat I expected. I really did enjoythe Khao SOI. It was a pleasant surprise. Me and my friend really enjoyed the creamy yet notes of the curry base. The egg Noddles were soaked well with the soup which made it enjoyable to eat. We both agreed that his was something we would come back to get.While the pork belly was not bad it was a little dry and nothing to write home about.The blue moon juice was a coconut juice with a fruit exlier that was blue in color (they did mention it was a type of flower). The color was too pretty to drink but was refreshing and did taste strongly of coconut juice. The colors went well with the blue interior around :p Definitely a must try and I'll definitely be back ;)

Came for an early dinner on a rainy weekday, ordered the Fried Papaya Salad, Pad Kee Mao and Garlic Oyster with Pork. The appetizer salad was the best out of the three.... The Pad kee Mao was too greasy and the oil flavor was overpowering. The Garlic Pork was so underwhelming I had to force myself to finish it as to not waste $13.  I'd have been happier with the Chinese food takeout I normally get. Not worth trekking the 30 minutes on the train to eat here, my local Thai restaurant in Woodside makes better quality food. What really drew me to the place was the decor and ambiance.....It looked cute from the outside but upon stepping in, the interior was tainted by the pungent odor of Fish Sauce, as if someone had wiped the floor with it....And when it rains, don't sit by the entrance window it leaks!!!"

Service is also pretty good.I'm so happy that there are so many different Thai cuisines in this neighborhood. So this place specializes in Northern Thai food. When it first opened it does not offer the more common Thai cuisines like curry. But I noticed that they have added several curry dishes to their menu. Anyways, I've tried three dishes: the Kanom Jeen Nam Ngeaw (pork rib noodle with pork blood), mango salad, and Khao soi noodles with chicken drumstick. The pork rib noodle has a lot of tomatoes in it and the broth is really greasy, so I did not like it very much. The mango salad is quite regular. But the Khao soi noodle is SO DELICIOUS! It's my first time having khao soi curry and I loved it so much that I finished all the broth.I think I would be interested to explore other dishes here. All in all I would recommend this place as the ambience is lovely and the menu is interesting."

Thai restaurants are a dime a dozen in NYC and everyone basically serves the same tried and true fare. Kudos to Lamoon for trying to make things a little more interesting. I had the pad thai infused with Thai iced tea, which was very sweet and tasty. A corworker had pad see ew that was mixed with tapioca pearls (like the ones in bubble tea) for a interesting texture. Even the water is flavored with pandan leaf, which I enjoyed but some of my friends did not.  All served in simple nautical interior with plenty of natural light. I would definitely come back here to try some of the other dishes."

What we ordered: - Khao soi with chicken price $12 - Khao soi might be the most well known Northern Thai dish among foreigners.  It is easy to see why, it is sweet and creamy from the coconut milk, it is not overly spicy, it has egg noodles and crispy noodles for crunchy texture and it includes a chicken drumstick (and who doesn't like drumsticks?).  This dish comes with pickled mustards, lime and red onions - make sure you include all these in the dish! I just wish that this khao soi was a little more spicy! - Khanom jeen nam ngeaw $12 - While khao soi might be the most well known, this dish might be the most beloved in Northern Thai cuisine.  It is like a stew with influences from Myanmar and the Chinese southern region of Yunnan.  It is made with a tangy tomato base, with lots of chili, pork ribs, minced pork and cubes of congealed pork blood. The noodles are thin rice vermicelli (khanom jeen).  It tastes tangy, savory, and is bursting with spiciness! I'm very thankful to my special Thai friend who introduced this to me! - Sai Aua $12 - Spicy northern Thai sausage that is most famous from the city of Chiang Mai.  It is usually filled with meat, chilis and herbs such as lemongrass, kaffir lime leaves and galangal. I felt like this sausage was 50% chilis, it was way too spicy for this weak sauce Cantonese! :( I do like that it was presented in a small bird's nest-like basket. **Conclusion: I will most definitely be coming back to try more Lanna cuisine!"

It must be experienced to understand its flavor.We also got the Brutal Spicy Spinal Cord dish - another absolutely delicious dish with succulent meat and amazing seasonings. Overall the food was amazing and definitely worth a return visit. I highly recommend coming."

It was a tough decision but hands-down, everything we ordered was a hit. Papaya salad, tea infused pad thai, pineapple curry, khao soi, crab egg plam, and khao tod. Service was fast and friendly.

But the food and the portion size served was no bueno. After sharing an appetizer and two entrees, we were still hungry. The dishes either lacked flavor or most of the them had the same flavor profile. Or maybe, just maybe I didn't order the right food..? I liked the glass noodle salad, but didn't have the same liking for the other two signature entrees. I don't think people mind paying more as long as an entree is fulfilling and satisfying. Or one could easily compromise the small portions for the flavor profile, but that deliciousness of lemongrass galangal herby freshness was just not there."

The service is great and so is the food. I had pad sriracha noodle which I recommend if you like pad see ew. It is spicy but if you like sriracha you will definitely enjoy it.

But here's the thing: it's much better than most three but it had too much hype but the food didn't quite impress me the way I thought it wood. I tried the pork spine soup which of all the dishes were my favorite. It was unique had great fish like (Umami) and lime flavor and the herbs were great. It wasn't as spicy as I thought to be and it could be less salty. But overall a unique dish and I kept on going back for more. I also ordered the red curry, som tam and fried chicken. Som tam was not very good. It was too salty but lacked that nice snazzy flavor of lime and chili. The crab was not too special on the salad. Red curry and fried chicken especially the fried chicken were quite good. But the place is new and clean and modern looking. It's cute and small. It's great for a date or to catch up with a friend. The staff was super friendly and it makes you want to come back. I would come back to try some other dishes like they had Thai iced tea noodles. How fun!The decor and menu is pretty."

We decided to give it a try and let me tell you it was not disappointed at all. They offer a authentic north Thai food which is very hard to find a food like this to eat in NYC. In fact, even you live in Thailand, food like this is hard to find. It was so perfectly delicious and well made that it took our breath away once we took the first bite. They mostly cook pork just to be as perfect as my mom cooking. That reminds me of my hometown. Their location is in Queens, Elmhurst R,M station, and right across from Top Line supermarket where you can buy Asian grocery to cook yourself. Believe me it great location to hang out. Thank to Lamoon, They have made my evening so beautifully perfect."

We ordered a couple of dishes. All had different flavors. I recommend their spicy sausage in appetizer. The crab egg dish in the appetizer section was light in flavor but still good. For entrée we had a beef glass noodle dish that was flavorful and filling, but I might be interested in trying their other dishes next time...there will be a next time. The coconut snow pea drink is a must if you love the coco. ;) We also had their very colorful mango sticky rice. It was tasty.

The interior design is adorable with paintings on the walls. The service was excellent. I ordered the Kanom Jeen Nom Ngeaw and my friend ordered the Khao Soi. I loved my dish because of how flavorful the broth was. The meat was tender as well. It definitely had a kick from the spices, so be careful! The curry from the Khao Soi was not too thick and had a strong coconut flavor. We ended our meal with mango sticky rice. It was my friend's favorite dish of the meal. The mango sticky rice came in a variety of colors and flavors. Definitely a must try!"

This isn't a takeout pad Thai joint. This is real Northern Thai cuisine. I highly recommend the signature dish. It's called Kanon jeen nam ngeaw: vermicelli in pork rib shrimp paste stew, blood cubes, & red cotton flowers. You can't go wrong with the mango salad either. It compliments the hearty signature dish because it's a cold refreshing dish. They even sprinkle some ant eggs over the top for you. The coconut water is really good too, but I wouldn't have minded an adult beverage with such a great meal. The staff was really friendly as well. I will be returning to Lamoon."

The walls are cute and there is a cozy feel to the placeItems Tasted:- Oh Liang: This is a milk based coffee drink. The taste was okay, but my bf liked it. It is more milk based than coffee- Thai Ice Tea: This is amazing and one of the prettiest Thai Ice Teas I've seen- Fried Rice Egg Wrap: I really enjoyed this. The seasoning on this is perfect-Khao Soi: Get this if you're a curry lover. I got a chicken drumstick for this curry and it was moist and tender-Hnam Kadook Moo (fermented pork ribs): I wouldn't recommend. There's no taste to this other than salt"

The Lamoon beef was nicely flavored, chewy but not like jerky. The pork brain comes out as a paste wrapped in a banana leaf - smelled delicious and was a bit too spicy for my husband. I wasn't brave enough to try it. Tamarind fish also good, a tad sweet but has a little bones so be careful and def not for little children to eat. Fermented pork ribs were the most flavorful and were very homey and were nicely fried like kurage. Lemongrass fried chicken was not marinated enough, had hardly any lemongrass flavor. Baby shrimp cloud cake needed the sauce, crispy. Thai tea pad thai was only ok - I couldn't really appreciate the Thai tea flavor and wouldn't order this again. The food is good but we felt most of the dishes had similar flavors and felt almost like eating the same thing over and over again. Service was friendly."

Now it's Northern Thai cusine.  At first try I think I will come back to try other dishes however it's not too my liking because the flavoring to too sweet when I wanted spicy for Thai experience.  I liked the fish itself, it's not fishy so even my friend who doesn't like fish ate some. I would just ask them to do the sauce on the side next time.  The minced pork is also sweet and not spicy at all (compare to other Thai who makes minced pork with basil oyster sauce soy-sauce fish sauce they made it with heavy with tamarind sauce is it's super sweet.  The rice portion is smaller than I expect with something so heavily seasoned you need more rice. The banana leaves crab meat egg is not good, sorry.I give 4 star because it's a clean place and hope they will continue to use better ingredients."

Driving 1.5 hrs from Staten Island to try this place on Jun224. And yelp said they open 11:30 and when we got there on 11:30 on time and their door is closed and not t day until noon. What a bad timing management.The service was ok the Decor is new and cute. But the food was so normal. I when ask the pork noodle soup for mild and they make it spicy. Which I feel very stomach after eat. Def not returning back and not recommend. I think the Ayada or spicy shallot or thai hainanese chicken restaurant around that area are way much better than this restaurant.

They feature many authentic spicy dishes (some that I personally can't handle but spice lovers would, well.. love lol) but one that stands out for me is the Khao Soi Chicken. It is probably my favorite curry dish in all of NYC - perfectly balanced with rich flavor. Make sure to add the pickled lettuce (cabbage?) and shallots that comes on the side. Finish your meal with their one dessert (that I know of), the rainbow sticky rice & mango, it is so tasty without being overly sweet.On top of the great food, the atmosphere is great with their incredible murals and staff. My server Gift was always attentive and had a smile that deserves a Michelin star. I'm definitely hooked and will come back often!"

I would estimate they can only seat about 20 people at a time (I wouldn't go with more than four people).  They serve northern Thai cuisine so if you're going for the usual Pad Thai or curries, you may be disappointed.  We tried the chicken wings, Kang Hoh (glass noodles with pork belly in a masala curry), Gai Toon (chicken noodle soup), Crab Egg Plam, Crispy Baby shrimp, and the fried fish special.  The chicken wings were fried and crispy and came with shrimp chips! The Kang Hoh had a nice flavor to it and it reminded me of something my dad cooks. The Gai Toon also had a nice flavor to it and was served with rice noodles and two large drumsticks that were rather tender with the meat falling off the bone. The chicken was flavorful and had a five spice flavor to it. The crab egg plam was basically an omelette with crab meat. The Crispy Baby shrimp was very interesting. It was a rather large portion, the size of a dinner plate. I'm not exactly sure what the baby shrimp was fried with but it was like eating one giant, crumbly shrimp chip. As an appetizer, it could probably feed 8 people! It was probably a mistake for us to order it because we couldn't finish it as it was quite filling (we were only 2 adults and 2 kids).  The crispy fish special was good - it wasn't a whole Fish served on the bone.  It was two filets served with vegetables.  They are also BYOB which is nice.  There is one bathroom but you have to walk through the kitchen to get to it, which is slightly weird but cool because you can see the action going on."

The high yelp score, plus it being on a NYC best cheap eats list I saw, I decided to check it out. I took a friend and both of us were disappointed.

My boyfriend and I really enjoyed the nam prik ong fried rice. It was very nicely cooked with a burst of flavors, the ""heat of the wok"" was very sufficient thus the rice came out very hot and smelled amazing! Of course the smears of shrimp paste on the side dish was not only a plus for the presentation of the dish but added additional flavor to the rice. The slow cooked kang hung ley ( curry pork belly) was also very good with the pork belly fully immersed in the not so spicy curry flavors.( even though I personally prefer the more spicy type of curries) . The papaya seafood salad was also really good mainly because I really liked the spicy sauce. My absolute fav though is the fried baby shrimp cloud cakes. It's a match made in heaven with the sweet chili dip. It's the reason why I've been making my boyfriend go back two additional times for take out because as I'm watching my dramas after work, it's just a snack that I can't stop thinking about. ( just to show how much I like it, we're still willing to go to elmhurst for just that alone even though we live in flushing) anyways def must try is the baby shrimp cloud cakes for those whom haven't bad a chance to visit this restaurant yet."

I haven't had a problem with the service, but i've just seen how it can be slow at times. The food makes up for it exponentially! Love the fried pork ribs and the Angie (best appetizers). the Angie is the best seafood/catfish salad you'll have at a Thai restaurant. The portions may seem small but they're suprisingly huge, I always leave with leftovers! I've had the pork curry/adobo type dish (don't remember the name), but it's delicious. Ultimate favorite was the garlic chicken served with the egg and rice; I could barely finish half! The sauce was delicious and fresh tasting. I have yet to try their fried rice and noodles, but can't wait to. Will be back!"

Very, very clean. Every table was taken on a Monday night. My friends and I ordered the baby shrimp cloud, the thai tea pad thai, the pink lady noodles, and the tamarind fish. It was all very good. I didn't care for the baby shrimp cloud, but that's just my personal taste buds (it wasn't bad, but I didn't love it as much as the other dishes). I can see why other people would like it, though. I absolutely loved the tamarind fish and cleaned my plate! We also split the mango rice. I'm normally NOT a fan of mango rice at other restaurants and wouldn't have ordered it if my friends hadn't wanted it, but it was actually delicious at Lamoon! Each color of rice was a different flavor, which made it so interesting to sample! We thought the portions were fair for the prices. I will be back!"

Hmmmm, its hard to say but im not typical thai who knows about thai food. Hahaha. Pretty much i have around 50% knowledge about Thai cuisine, dont mention about specific Northern thai cuisine. LolSo i decided to give it a try @lamoon, which i chose the Nam Prik Ong as my entree. I was impressed by the dish itself. Its white blue color contradicts to the food which is reddish. Hmmmm. Thats impressed. The taste of Nam prik ong is quiet a bit spicy as informed by the server. However the assorted veggies on the side compromise the spiciness very well. It saved my stomach from the heat of food. So far i liked it. If you cant handle the spicy food probably rhai ice tea would calm you down. Enjoy!!!"

I tried the jor pak kad ....Fresh and crunchy... also Savory and  also listed on the $10 special lunch menu. The pork in the soup was extremely soft, tender, and simply delicious.  Side condiments of bean sprouts and pickle gives  balance of the sweet and sour, which  is a staple in typical Thai cuisine.   The filet tamarind Was delicious and crisp and easily pulled from the skin; the dish was decorated with pomegranate seeds... and flavored with baby bok choy.  Adding a dash of the fried hot red paper gives you a nice firey taste ; and again exemplifies the balance of hot and sweet in this great cuisine.   You can skip The White Rice side dish... it's simply a filler.   I went off the special lunch menu and onto the main entrées and tried the incredible hot and spicy dish of Kanom Jeen Nam Ngeaw... chili with pork ribs and shrimp paste, blood cubes, red cotton flowers and tomatoes... Incredibly unforgettable... if you are a practicing Bhuddist....this maybe your Nirvana.   A large dish and savory that is second to none!   I am truly enlightened."

Small setting with a great vibe. I always like to try new places and this one stood out from recent experiences. Never tried the Thai Iced tea, so I guess he knew I don't eat much Thai food, so he explained every dish we ordered as they brought out. The waitress said the jackfruit was the most popular so I ordered that and my buddies ordered the kang hung ley (pork belly) I didnt have a huge taste for the jackfruit (very flavorful just not a flavor for me) but I LOVED the kang hung ley.

The place is small but very cutely decorated - it reminded me a lot of the actual restaurants I went to during my trip to Thailand a few years ago. I was with some people, and we ordered a Thai tea pad Thai (I know so different - this place has some interesting things!) and two khao soys. I ordered the pad Thai and it came out first. Since I was close to the door on a cold day, I moved it to the side while I waited for everyone else's food. A worker quickly jumped up and asked me if I didn't like my food and could bring my something new. I really appreciated how attentive they were and told him I just simply pushed my food aside so it didn't get cold. He then offered to take it to the back to keep it warm, which I agreed to. When all the food came out, we loved it all. I did like the khao soy better but that's purely because that's my favorite Thai dish- the pad Thai was one of the best I've ever had. I really enjoyed my experience - from the service to the food to the atmosphere - and highly recommend!"

The waiters and waitresses is very generous and caring to their customers. I felt like a little princess while I was dining there. The food is also awesome. It is not easy to find the Northern Thai food in NYC in matter of the fact any places beside Thailand however this place really made me felt that I'm in Thailand eating the food from the local. The popular dish is Jackfruit salad which is so delicious. Jackfruit salad also came with sticky rice and crispy  pork skin. Not only that most restaurant will give you ice water for free but this place will give you water with a hint of Pandan which is a plus. This is just amazing. The price is also very reasonable. I wish you could give more than 5 star. This is just WOW!!! Everyone please come and try out this place.  Will definitely returning soon. Because my heart is calling for the food from that place.

Very interesting menu.  Downside is that it's Not family friendly at all. No highchair available (which seems like such a poor choice to make). The bathroom is very awkward in the back and you have to pass through the kitchen.

Very unique flavor and presentation of food. It is not your typical thai restaurant. My husband even said their flavors took him back to Thailand. We tried the thai sausage, curry egg noodles, pork belly, and shrimp cloud cake. All taste good. Not to mention this place is very child friendly. I have two fidgety toddlers and the waiters were very patient and understanding, even sharing his own toys for them to play. The mango rainbow sticky rice dessert was one-of-a-kind. We will be back."

It is extremely overpriced with small portions of food. Also when I asked for water without ice, I received ice water that tasted like rice. There is also bad waitering and it doesn't seem like it is very spacious. The one good thing was that the food came fast but that's was because the places business was running very bad. Overall the food was disgusting, the waiters were and and took time, and the space was cramped. I came in expecting a nice Thai dinner and left hungry and feeling robbed. Very overpriced."

What a great choice! We only tried the Yum Jin Gai, and the rice balls...oh and we got to sample the traditional pork jerky. Everything was fresh, tasty and prepared with care. The owner was so gracious and hospitable, too. We had tons of questions because the menu was quite different from other Thai places we've visited. The owner explained that the menu is made up of traditional northern Thai dishes. I haven't been to Thailand (yet!) but eating here definitely made me want to visit--especially the north. Everyone in our party of 6 tried the soup and loved it. Really delicious!! We also loved the rice balls and jerky. Try this place. You will not be disappointed. The restaurant is also spotless and nicely decorated. The owners take pride in providing great, authentic Northern Thai cuisine. Great experience! We will be back!"

It was great! The waiters were super nice and tried their best to accommodate us (three people) since it was a pretty small restaurant. Highly recommend the pink lady, pork belly with curry, and jackfruit salad. Checking in also got us some free drinks. We ended with the rainbow mango sticky rice, which was sweet and pleasant. This is very different from the usual Thai fare you would find; you won't find any pad thai or green curry here. This is apparently a Northern Thai restaurant (I never knew there was such a thing, actually). Will definitely be coming back to try the rest of the dishes they have."

It specializes in Northern Thai food, which is different from the sort of Thai that everyone is used to. You're not going to find panang curry or pad kee mao here, nor are you going to find the Esaan cuisine that dominates in this neighborhood. It is a very unique experience, I doubt there is another restaurant like this in New York City. I recommend trying Khao Soi chicken, a tasty coconutty curry with crunchy noodles. Jackfruit salad is strange but very interesting, almost tastes like chicken. The fried papaya salad (I think it's called ""Angie"") is also really good. If you are adventurous, get the sticky rice cooked in pork blood. A really unusual flavor, although those who have tried Argentinian food may compare it to the morcilla. The Thai sausage is really good as well. Not as exotic as some of the other items on the list, but really good if you want something familiar. Overall the experience was amazing. This restaurant has amazing food and service, and I would not be surprised if they became as popular as SriPraPhai or Ayada."

The place reminds me of going to a friend's home and eating a home cook meal. Not much food to choose from. It's actually a good thing for someone like me who wants to try everything. The place is homey rather than cozy. Both waiter and waitress are super attentive. Overall I enjoy the place. The downside of the place is that their vegetarian option is very limited.

There are a number of great Thai restaurants in the Elmhurst area, and I particularly like the restaurants that specialize in Northern Thai dishes. Lamoon had some unusual dishes on their menu and looked like a cute space, so I was intrigued. We ordered the jasmine rice and ground pork marinated in pork blood for the appetizer and two entrees - a stewed curry pork dish for my boyfriend and the green curry fried rice for myself. The appetizer did not set the stage well - it was dry and rather bland with a metallic aftertaste. My fried rice was so dull, despite the server saying it was quite spicy, that I had to put several teaspoons of chili flakes on it. My boyfriend's stewed curry pork had a good flavor, fortunately, so I wound up spooning that over my rice as well to give it flavor. They didn't skimp on the fried rice portion, but there was just nothing there flavor-wise - and very few veggies or anything in it. One of the worst fried rices I've had in a while. Overall, the food left me feeling like I'd wait a while - a long while - before coming back. The stewed curry pork dish and the nice server are the only things keeping my review at 3 stars rather than 2."

I don't live too far so I'm in delivery range, which is great for me. I've already ordered from them a few times. Easy and quick and their delivery guy is nice. It's greek themed but they have burgers, salads, platters, and a bunch more. I've tried the fish, gyro platters, burgers and a few of the appetizers so far. Everything we've had so far has been excellent. There aren't too many Greek options in this area so this place hits the spot. I'll have to actually try to dine in as well one of these days."

On the two occasions I have been there, the service and food has been impeccable each time. During my first visit, I had the crab stuffed shrimp and lamb chops. I usually don't enjoy  most dishes stuffed with crab because I find that the crab tends to be overcooked or dry or too heavily breaded. I was pleasantly surprised to find that the crab stuffed shrimp at Nick's was absolutely delicious. The shrimp was succulent and the crab was light, fresh and seasoned to perfection. The lamb chops were mouth wateringly tender and flavorful. These are both dishes that I would happily get again.During my second visit, my friend and I ordered the grape leaves and mussels for our appetizer. My friend doesn't usually enjoy grape leaves but she loved them at Nick's. The mussels were very fresh and the tomato sauce was rich without overpowering the mussels. My friend ordered the Asian Sea Bass and I ordered the crab stuffed (yep, I'm sold with their crab) sea bass. We both thoroughly enjoyed our meals. The servings at Nick's are relatively large so I had enough left overs to take home. My fish tasted just as delicious the next day, which speaks highly to the freshness of the ingredients Nick's Bistro utilizes in their cooking. In short, I love this neighborhood spot and am a loyal patron. Don't ever change, Nick!"

Yesterday we actually had dinner, which rekindled our feelings about Nick's. First off I wanted to mention how we love this little part of Forest Hills. It's quiet and secluded, plus it feels like it's somehow stuck in time... Love it!I never associated Nick's with Greek food. I always envisioned it as a feel-good, home-growned, family owned restaurant that is heavily supported by the community. You can feel it, sense it and taste it. As for the taste, the food is delicious and the service is nothing short of fantastic! It's just a great place to be on a Saturday night. The locals make it even more comforting and appealing. Is it just me or do I usually see teachers here... food for thought???To us, Nick's is part of the Trifecta of Cinemart, Nick's and Eddie's. Always a highlight on any given weekend. You will never lose!!One request to Nick's. If you can make a little brother in Bayside, that will be amazing, hehehe!"

The food is delicious and the service is great.On both visits, we basically ordered the same thing because it was so good the first time. We started off with fried calamari, very fresh and tender, good sauce too served nice and hot. For our main course, we ordered the pork souvlaki and spicy seafood pasta. Just to be clear, first visit was for dinner, second visit was lunch. The lunch menu is different however, if you want stuff from the dinner menu such as pasta, you can still ask for it.The pork souvlaki was excellent. Very juicy and tender. The lemon potatoes were great. Also comes with a small bowl of salad and pita. The spicy seafood pasta was enormous. It comes with lots of mussels and shrimps.Verdict - a little pricey but the quality is top notch. Highly recommend this restaurant, easily beats out any restaurant on Austin St."

An hour and 15 mins after ordering they said all their orders were out for delivery, almost 2 hours later they said the driver picked up the orders and it will be there shortly. 2.5 hours later the story is now that they had sent it out very quickly and I should've already gotten it. They insisted that the driver had delivered it and left it with the doorman. I don't have a doorman so clearly the driver delivered it to the wrong place. They insisted that it was delivered and offered no resolution to the issue. I had to go through delivery.com and was told that the restaurant requested the issue be escalated to management and I had to wait 24-48 hours for management to reach out to me, which they never did. They need a new person to answer the phones, terrible customer service and made me feel like I was in the wrong when clearly your driver made the mistake. Just own up to it."

I don't get why this restaurant has a strong 4.5 star rating when I have never experienced extraordinary food or impeccable service after numerous visits. I keep giving it another try thinking I must be missing something, but at last, I don't think so. Unfortunately, Nick's is just an average restaurant.First of all, knowing it's a Greek restaurant, we have tried many authentic Greek dishes in the past. Nothing bad, but nowhere near the quality of what you can get in Astoria. Maybe people around here settled for subpar Greek/Mediterranean food, but I rather drive all the way to Astoria.Today, stopped in with a friend for a quick bite. I got the Lamb Gyro Sandwich and he ordered a Porcini Cheeseburger. Gyro was fine but nothing to rave about. The burger however needed to be returned since it was super well done and not medium rare at all.  On the second go around, it was well done again, but we ran out of time to return it. Took a few bites and ran.Servers were friendly enough, did not complain when we sent back the food and apologized for the mistake. Yet, they never came back to check on the new burger, which was slightly better but still not what my friend ordered. Oh well, fool me once, shame on you. Fool me a half dozen times, I'm a complete idiot. Lol"

It has a very cozy setting and the staff is kind. Not to mention, the food is spectacular! The lamb gyro is to DIE for and the crab cakes are really tasty and flavorful. I would definitely recommend the burger and fries. This restaurant certainly does NOT seem like a place to get a burger, but it is. I have no doubt saying this, but this restaurant has the BEST burger I have ever had. I will come back here no matter what."

The food was delicious, the staff were great, and the overall experience was pleasant. This place is good vibe for all occasions: family dinners, dates, even just a good solo meal.I suggest getting entree special of lobster ravioli. It was filling and you can really taste the seafood. The sauce was tasty and a little sweet. The apple crisp dessert was huge. It was a rich blend of salty caramel and apple with a hefty scoop of ice cream on top. I would definitely go again for a nice bite in forrest hills that's not the usual Austin street restaurants. Also, the live music was beautiful esp on Tuesdays!"

However, you have to take in to account that most restaurants were closed. The restaurant had a nice cozy vibe and the service was friendly and efficient.Their homemade falafels were really delicious and the fries were cooked to perfection. I even loved their salad dressing because it was extremely acidic yet creamy and delicious. However, my mistake was that I ordered the grilled chicken, goat cheese and fig Panini and it was a little sweet for me. I knew I should've went with the souvlaki. I can't wait to go back and try the lobster avocado roll for brunch when I get a chance and I would love to try the mussels and spanakopita as well."

We ordered they special for the day; crab meat and shrimp sliders ( not sure if this is where I went wrong but I believe it was) and for entrees we ordered:Pork Chops, Lamb Gyro and someone sort of lemon chicken with the wildfire drinks. All I know is that 45 minutes into the dinner I started to feel sick so I asked to leave.

The complementary warm pita and hummus to start was a nice touch and we order the mixed gyro/seafood plate and the pork souvlaki. Gyro was fine but the shrimp was fantastic. Pork was flavorful and tender (tough pork is awful but unfortunately common elsewhere) but I wished they used a different cut. I've had amazing pork souvlaki at random roadside stands in Greece and I'm still looking for that in the city somewhere. Not luck so far. Overall solid place that I'd go back to if I were in the area. Don't forget to get the sour cherry soda, it's good."

I got this off the menu expecting at least a little more. I called and they said nope that's correct only 5 or 6 pieces. For $18 I think that's a little crazy.

Our server was kind and patient with my multiple wine taste requests (it's hard to choose a bottle for three people including my 88-year old birthday girl great aunt). We chose one of the Greek wines and we loved it! The zucchini fritter dill cream sauce special appetizer was amazing.  We shared the falafel plate and the lamb gyro plate and everything was perfect, and that was plenty of food for 3! plus a little birthday surprise baklava.  my mom and I are totally the people that stare at all of the food that everyone else gets, very easy in a small bistro, and every dish looked honestly beautiful and delicious. And then when my mom left her purse behind, we came back to more joyful people who had kindly found it and told us they'd considered just dropping it off until they saw my moms address in CA... but that spoke volumes about this little gem on the corner of Metropolitan Ave, where it seems like locals gather but lucky people like us also stumble into."

Ordered the vegetable chips and a large Greek salad with gyro meat. Perfect sized app and salad that filled me up for the night. The vegetable chips, which were zucchini and squash, were delicious. The tzatziki sauce was delicious I loved the pieces of cucumber, I think. The lamb was a bit greasy but I didn't care bc it was delicious.  The salad was so fresh, cucumbers cherry tomatoes red onions, I mean it's a classic Greek salad. Very good.

We chose Nicks Bistro in a party of 10.  We were seated outside and I got the lamb gyro sandwich ($8).  It was very tasty and they were generous with the baby tomatoes and greens.  The size is pretty decent and I could have eaten another one for sure.  My wife got the wild salmon Greek salad which she enjoyed as well. My son got the Italian chicken breast sandwich with lemon potatoes.  Wow those potatoes rock for sure.  All in all, we enjoyed our meal and the service was top notch.  All the staffs were very friendly and attentive.  Will definitely come back again soon for sure."

When I was looking up Mediterranean restaurants around me and saw this place pop up, I had to try it. No disappointment here on a weekday afternoon for lunch. Quick, courteous service. Lunch special prices are quite reasonable. I had a broiled salmon filet over Greek salad. The salmon was perfectly cooked. The salad was perfectly simple--a hunk of feta, a stuffed grape leaf, and a nicely dressed salad. Will definitely return to try other options on their menu."

The best thing I've eaten since moving to NYC a couple months ago and hands down the BEST falafel I've had, literally WORLDWIDE! I'm a falafel junkie and get them everywhere and this is by far the best! Don't think of those dry flavorless ones you have had before - this is moist (god I hate that word, but this is the only way to really capture them) and flavorful! I've dined in only once but loved the friendly staff and laid back atmosphere.  I am however, guilty of ordering this wrap through delivery about once a week and it never disappoints!! I'll take pictures next time - it never seems to last long enough for me to remember before I gobble it up! Check this place out - I'm sure the rest of the food is equally as good!"

I was very excited and raved to him about how good the food was. I had made a reservation since it was a Saturday night and I figured it would be busy. Needless to say, upon arrival it was packed. We walked in and expected to be greated by a hostess to whom we would tell we had a reservation. 10 minutes pass and we were not acknowledged by a single worker. I work in the restaurant business and I know how easy it is to get caught up with trying to keep things running smoothly. However, it got worse when a couple walked in after us and the hostess walked right up to them said hello and told them they would have a table ready soon...At this point we were still NOT acknowledged. So I then had to get the hostesses attention and tell him we had a reservation for 8:00 pm. We arrived about 5 minutes early and it was now 8:15 by the time we were ACKNOWLEDGED. I understand waiting for a table, but this was extremely rude and unprofessional. I was HIGHLY disappointed as I was just raving about how good this place is. We're finally sat in the corner where a waiter (who was very kind and accommodating) couldn't even reach our table. Whatever this was fine as I was about to walk out and was just happy to be seated. I ordered the falafel platter which was delicious and made up for the rudeness earlier. My boyfriend had a cheeseburger to which he took two bites out of and did not eat the rest of it as he said it wasn't good (he is not a picky eater). I expected better of this place and I will not be returning after the unkind service and lack of professionalism. Three stars for my falafel and very nice waiter."

I ordered takeout by phone and John was very pleasant in taking the order. I was planning to order Lemon Potatoes as a side but they were offereing a complementary side with each entree. I ordered a large greek salad to share, Filet of Flounder stuffed with spinach and feta with Lemon Potatoes, Chicken Kebob with Lemon Potatoes, and a dessert order of Baklava. The order was ready when we arrived for pickup and it was then we learned that Nick's was offering 10% off for takeout. Very thoughtful of them. The salad was excellent as was the Chicken Kabob and the Stuffed Flounder that was large enough for two to share. Surprisingly, there was no Lemon Potatoes, only Rice Pilaf. I guess they ran out of the potatoes and substituted the Rice Pilar which was excellent. We were too full for the Baklava which will have to wait a day before we try it.

I also asked for the omelet not to be  prepared with butter, but realized with my problem communicating with my server, that was a long shot. Even though mine was the only order being prepared, it took 15 minutes before it arrived, with a lot of onions (and a side of bread).  When my omelet did finally arrive, prepared properly, it was disappointing. Very flat frittata style, with greasy home fries.In fairness, for the delay I was comp'ed my coffee.  The waiter handling the coffee service was outstanding, keeping my cup filled.  But I honestly rather have paid for it and enjoyed my meal.This was my first omelet at Nicks.  In  the past I have had wonderful eggs benedict.  Omelets may simply not be their thing.  Nevertheless, I will not be returning anytime soon."

I got the pork soulvakia and it looked like it was put together by myself lol (I can't cook) as it was just cubes of pork, pita bread, and fries thrown together on a round plate, that's it!"

I suggested this place based on the reviews. We all got different dishes. We liked 3 out of the 5 choices. I chose the Tilapia. It was bland and the broccoli was cold. They substituted a different dish which slightly made up for other dish. We decided we wouldn't go back. It wasn't worth the money we spent there.

We see never disappointed.. We typically order delivery but have also eaten at the restaurant as it has a nice ambiance. Food is pricey as per usual with Greek but it's worth it.

I made a reservation for 2 on the Yelp App. Upon arrival, I was told there was no reservation within their system. I showed the confirmation emails + texts to the host and was escorted to a table about 5mins later. The area has street parking which could easily be found or a total nightmare. The restaurant itself had about one free table. My friend and I both got the chicken souvlaki platters ($14.95). She got a club soda ($2) and i got a sprite ($3). $3 for sprite ... come on Nick's . Seriously? DO . BETTER. It tasted like water with fizz and some sugar but whatever, i'll let you live!!!!!For dessert: Baklava- exceptional !Our entrees were large and delicious. Mine came with french fries and pita while my friend's was paired with rice. Bottom Line: Good greek food with friendly staff. I'd go again."

The server was friendly and attentive. The menu is not vast so choosing comes easily except everything seems bland. I got the braised beef burger with Greek salad and the salmon with feta cheese salad. The salmon was about 4 oz, very little for $15. The salad it sat on wasn't enough as well. The burger's meat was juicy with bbq sauce, but covered in a thick layer of American cheddar cheese; Nobody need that much bad cheese on anything. I didn't see where it said cheese so I didn't bother to have them remove it. But It wasn't easy to remove due to the sticky nature of the cheese to the meat. Overall, I wouldn't waste money here again. The price for quality is not worth it."

For apps, we got a combo of a few items (they have an option to do that I believe) - most notable were the stuffed mushrooms and crab cakes! The calamari was pretty standard.As for mains, we both got the gyro sandwich, which we found to be quite disappointing. The gyro itself did not taste fresh, and the SO suspected it might be the frozen variety. It was slightly rubbery in texture for some reason, and tasted quite lackluster.Overall a meh experience."

We started with pita with hummus and ordered more dips to start. All so good!  The falafel was good even though I'm typically not a fan of it. We also had the platter that came with 3 options for $19. Well worth it!I ordered the lamb loin chops and they were done nicely!  Very flavorful and despite already being full from appetizers I finished my food. The salad was also fresh with a house made dressing. We skipped dessert but I'm sure that's yummy as well. I will definitely be back!

I went Tuesday and they had a singer singing with his guitar which made the mood super relax and fun. The place is not big but is very confortable and the decoration is very fun. We had the Nicks Trio for which I chose the Lountza , dolmadthes and the crab cakes, the order came in very fast and every item was delicious, the marinated pork lion was juicy and flavorful, the crab cakes were very soft and warm, and lastly the grape rolls were so good. I had the steak as my entry and the eggplant roll as a side. The roll was so good i didn't even finish the steak and took it home. If you like eggplant the eggplant roll is a must. Had a good time overall will definitely go back."

My boyfriend ordered the shrimp, scallops and lobster ravioli.  It was tasty and the sauce was well done. we look forward to going back to try other dishes."

My friend and I split an order of moussaka (it is HUGE) and an order of scallops. Both were excellent, and balanced each other nicely. Next time I might opt to split a moussaka and a salad instead so we might be a little less stuffed. The cocktails were very decent, I had something with rye on their craft list and liked it a lot though it was slightly sweet. This is going to be in regular rotation."

The staff is so welcoming and the food is delicious. Everything we ordered was outstanding! We were visiting our daughter and she wanted to share one of her favorite local eateries and we were certainly not disappointed. The atmosphere is warm and inviting.

AMAZING FOOD. And even better service. I ordered the surf n turf, because of the waiteress Lara's recommendation. It was beyond good, the steak was so tender, juicy, and packed with flavor. The mash potatoes was creamy, and delicious. The Lobster tail was cooked to perfection. I would highly recommend this entree to anyone who comes in. My boyfriend ordered the filet mignon kebab. He absolutely LOVED it! He finished his whole plate off , and even said the rice pilaf is to die for. There were several people who made sure to come to the table to ensure we were having a great experience. They provided pleasant conversation, and we enjoyed talking to them. Overall, it was a excellent experience , and I highly suggest you come to this restaurant to eat.  One of the best restuarants we've come to in a long time. 10/10.P.S You MUST try the lobester tails!!!!!!"

Great location, popular street. Parking is always tough in this area but Nicks is totally worth.They took us as a last minute reservation and we showed up early, yet were seated immediately! Kudos for that. The pita bread with hummus was served so quickly and was delicious, we asked for a second plate.Our kind Croatian waitress was a doll and very attentive. She was working many many tables and still served all of us properly. We started with coconut shrimp (bangin'),and stuffed grape leaves. I must say, their knives are not sharp enough. Get new silverware!For the entree i stuck with the grilled octopus, which was good. a little too buttery but too good to take away a star. Definitely worth a visit!"

That's why I kept skipping it whenever I visited Metropolitan to catch a film at Cinemart.The rude waitress was no longer there and it looks like the cook has changed too. Nick's was never bad food, but it has gone from ""eh, it's Forest Hills dining,"" to ""Wow. Just wow. I thought I was in Astoria!""I ordered the shrimp and lobster fettucini and it was absolutely delicious. Hubby ordered shrimp stuffed with crab meat. It came with a side of lemon potatoes. He swooned. He said it was one of the best meals he's ever had (and this includes meals in Williamsburg, Park Slope, Astoria, UWS, Soho, Tribeca, etc).The chef, a beefy dude, even came out to make sure everyone was enjoying their meal. Now that's being conscientious! How often do you see that? I thought I was dining at a Michelin starred-restaurant or dining with Gordon Ramsey.I haven't had such great food since I moved out of Astoria and into the geriatric foodie desert that is Forest Hills. Now if only the other restaurants in the Hills would measure up, I'd be in foodie heaven."

The area is small (seats ~24 ppl), so its best if you arrive earlier. We got complimentary toasted pita bread with humus while we were waiting for another friend to arrive. K and I ordered grilled Mediterranean octopus, Gyro platter and jumbo shrimp stuffed with crab meat.Our friends ordered the lamb shank, wild salmon, lamb kebobs, and chicken souvlaki.The grilled octopus was charred but overcooked, so the texture was mushy and the sauce was a little too sour. My jumbo shrimp came as a shrimp scampi, without the crab meat but I ate it anyway. I wish there were more shrimp than 5 pieces but K's dish had more than enough for him, so he shared. K's gyro platter was delicious and plentiful! Definitely getting this next time! I'm happy to say my friends seemed satisfied with the meal. All my friends were happily munching away at their lamb and chicken. The lamb shank was somewhat tender and bigger than my hand! My girl friend told me that 'the flavors were good, I just wanted the lamb softer and melting off the bone.' The lamb kebobs was cooked to order (medium) and my friend appeared happy while eating it. We sat and laughed and talked for a couple hours. We got rounds of espresso and baklava to share. Very crispy honey-sweet baklava. Someone didn't eat their piece of baklava so one of my friends and I split the remaining one. So good. Two days later, we joined my family for brunch. We ordered blueberry cream cheese french toast, crab benedict and pork souvlaki. This time, all the dishes were well made! The French toast was crispy and fluffy, and I liked the blueberry cream cheese. The crab benedict had a good amount of crab and perfectly soft runny poached egg. And the pork souvlaki had tender half fatty pieces of pork. I definitely wanted that dish all to myself! And my nephew loved the crab benedict and the home fries. He kept saying mmmmm, and reaching for more! The staff was great and so is the neighborhood. I will definitely be back and now I know what to order next time!"

Not really a waiting area inside the restaurant and I gave my name to the woman carrying a notepad. The wait should have been like 15-20 mins but we waited much longer since the people before us decided to give up their table to the elderly couple and two companions that came after me and Andrea. It was a nice gesture but still pushed back the time for us to sit down and enjoy our dinner. The heat lamps are toasty if you are standing right in front of it. Seriously what's the point of giving your name, if the guy had to come out and asked whose next...that just annoyed me. Andrea G was going to try the Shrimp Souvlaki Platter but changed her mind when she saw the dinner specials and wanted to try the Shrimp Linguine. I decided lets just do a shrimp night. I choose French Fries to come with the Shrimp Souvlaki. They finally brought out to everyone's table a plate of complimentary pita with hummus and black eye peas.Our server brought out our dishes, I saw the rice next to the Shrimp Souvalki and I told him French Fries and plus they cooked the rice in chicken stock which I overheard from the table next to us. Well my friend is a vegetarian so no chicken stock rice for us since we were sharing the two dishes. We started the Shrimp Linguine...tasty but the linguine was a bit bland though and I love shrimps with the tail still intact. I did like the creamy sauce along with the peas..mmmm!Finally our Shrimp Souvalki was brought back to our table, yummy shrimp with the grilled marks on them. Overall, the food was yummy but we finally crossed this off our bookmarks!"

When we got there Anna put her name down and we were told there was a 15-20min wait. I didnt mind except for the fact that you have to wait outside and once it gets colder thats going to be a pain, especially since they dont take reservations for parties of two.For dinner we decided to share two dishesShrimp Linguine, which was pretty good but couldve used a little more seasoning. Shrimp Souvlaki with french fries. The shrimp was cooked perfectly and the fries were nice and crispy.Overall I would say it was a good dinner and I would probably go back again."

I have met the owner a few times and he's a pretty cool guy. The place is really cute and quaint and really nice during the summer.

Ordered some apps and was very pleased. Ordered 2 spreads and pita bread. Melitzanosalata (Eggplant) spread and tirokafteri (Spiced Feta). Both were delicious. I also ordered the greek sausage, greek meatballs and stuffed mushrooms with crab meat. The apps were authentic, well seasoned and fresh. For Entrees I had one of myFavorite greek dishes Pastitsio. And theirs was fantastic, large portion, great macaroni, bechamel sauce and tomato sauce were all seasoned with the greek authenticity Ive come to love in their dishes. The red wine selection was great as well. If you are in queens and not in Astoria definitely come over to Forest Hills and try Nicks Bistro.

Came here on Sunday evening and got a spot right away. It was empty at first but quickly filled up.They gave us some pita with humus for starters and the bartender came to us and asked us what we would Ike to drink. She was very nice and gave her recommendations. The food was good. Nothing awesome about it but it was good like a regular Greek spot. I ordered a chicken slovaki and my friend ordered another chicken dish (don't recall the name of dish) but it was a flat chicken dish with lemon potatoes. Parking was easy for a Sunday evening. May come back here again but not a must.

Food was delicious!!!!! And it was in big portions. The service was amazing as well. Our server realized I might not be eating meat and actually offered grape leaves with only rice in it!

However, ordered the gyro - this is fake gyro meat! It has filler in it and reminds me of frozen reheated gyro you buy on the street. NOT GOOD.  (Compare to Taci down the block, real amazing gyro and cheaper)Other dishes are probably good but was definitely put off by overpriced fake meat"

We decided not to eat in because we figured it would take longer, and since we had just gone grocery shopping, we didn't want our groceries to spoil in the car.We went in and placed our order, and everything went smoothly thus far. The waiter even kindly told us we could have waited on the bench outside if we wanted to, and he would have brought our food to us as soon as it was ready.We did, and after 40 minutes of waiting and receiving no updates, I walked back into the restaurant. I walked by two other staff members who told me that our food was being packed. Ten minutes later, I walked in again, and after inquiring about the status of our order I was asked which one was our order, and then I was told again that our food was being packed. After I said that I had been told the same 10 minutes before, the staff apologized. Another 5 minutes went by and the food was finally ready. The  waiter apologized and said they had put free dessert in our bag (4 bites of Baklava).When we arrived home, quite angry for the long wait, we had some more unpleasant surprises: the container with my food hadn't been closed properly and all the condiments had spilled. In addition, my wife had ordered a side of rice; guess what was in her container...potatoes!! Finally, the groceries we had bought were all melted thanks to the extremely long wait. So in addition to the $40 we spent at Nick's, we also wasted $80 in groceries since we had to throw them all in the garbage; not to mention the time that we are going to have to waste again, having to return to the grocery store and buy the same groceries again.What's most upsetting is that the restaurant was quite empty on a Monday evening (maybe 5 tables had guests), so it's not that they were busy. They should have informed us we would have had to wait and we would have either went somewhere else, or placed our order, driven back home and gone back to pick it up, being able to put our groceries in the freezer and not have them spoiled.So yes, we are quite upset, and we don't think we are going to return to this restaurant."

Based on the reviews this place should have been a slam dunk but instead it was an epic miss. The wait for our food was over 30minutes after we ordered & the place was no where near full at 3:00pm in the afternoon. The food was really not good. It was indeed edible hence 2 stars, not 1. I am pissed for wasting my time & money on this place instead of having a quality meal else where. Note to self, yelp is not always right."

There's outdoor seating available with a nice set up if you want. You could probably bring your dog to hang out too. I'm vegan/Gluten Free and I really appreciated the menu being labeled with GF options. We started off with an app of pita and hummus/beans (+ GF pita) which we really enjoyed. The GF pita was really good, something I haven't had. I opted for the quinoa falafel with lemon potato wedges and a side salad. SO DELICIOUS! They were kind enough to swap the dairy dipping sauce for hummus and I was thrilled. The hummus had a really nice texture, tasted homemade. My friend ordered the skirt steak and she really loved it as well.We've both been living in the neighborhood for over 10yrs and this was our first time here but certainly not the last!"

We were greeted right away and seated with a delicious plate of soft pita and hummus spread! For appetizer we had the fried calamari which was perfectly crispy and a delicious hot dipping sauce. For dinner I ordered the seafood salad which I have to say was out of this world! The portion was generous and the shrimp, calamari, and octopus were all grilled to perfection. The dressing was light and very good too! My boyfriend ordered the steak, it came covered in a thick sauce with grilled vegetables spread over top. Overall it was really delicious! The only thing I would change was that it was slightly too cold inside the restaurant but otherwise everything was perfect! We will be back!"

It's nice little bistro, has an outside seating area too. It does get busy super fast so recommend rsvp especially for outside seating. Plates are bit expensive but worth it. I had the Athenian fish entree and my bro had the filet steak I think. All of our food were super tasty and worth every bite. We got the brownie w ice cream ! Highly recommend - big portion so I was glad we 3 shared one dessert. There house red wine Cabernet was so nice and silky! Loved it. I def will go back since I live close by, place is pretty popular, waiters are friendly. They came by often to provide anything we needed. One little comment I would make that can be better is the smell inside the bistro, was a bit pungent. Perhaps it was the cheese they were using, but then again it was my first time. Don't know if that's a normal thing there but I would still go back and if that the case sit outside :)Food is def exceptional."

First time I came here I ordered the mixed shwarma and nicks appetizer combo which consisted of calamari, greek sausages and crab cakes. the appetizers were absolutely amazing! the calamari was some of the softest and most delicious I've ever had in my life, moist and done extremely well definitely recommend everyone get this item when you visit, same goes for the crab cake, extremely hardy portions with actual crab chunks in it, again one of the best crab cakes I've ever had. I really enjoyed the sausages as they were extremely moist and fatty, but they may not be everyones cup of tea since they were pretty fatty and tasted pretty gamey. My biggest disappointment was the shawarma, the meat was incredibly dry and the yogurt sauce non existant, the food item also literally broke apart before I even took my first bite, one of the worst shwarmas I've ever tasted in my life, absolutely avoid at all cost.I came back here because I was salivation over the appetizers. This time around I ordered the pork chops and the same appetizers but swapping the sausages for greek meatballs. The meatballs tasted fine, very moist but a strong hint of mint was mixed into the concoction. Pork chops again were done fantastically. They gave me two very large healthy portions, and the pork came out tender and done very clean and simply yet incredibly delicious.in essence come here definitely get the appetizers at all costs! avoid the shwarma like the plague and everything else is fair game, I definitely recommend this place"

Talk about hidden gem!I've been passing this place for years and never thought to give it a try. I am kicking myself right now. On Sunday I came here for brunch with my mother. I ordered a Bellini - it was fabulous. But let's get to why were really here. The food!For an appetizer we ordered the crab stuff portobello mushroom. Oh my god. This was amazing. I could have had two orders and been fine with just that.However - I ordered the lamb burger & sweet potato fries with a side of tirokefteri (aka spicy feta dip) AMAZING!!!!!My mother ordered a Greek omelette that she put the tirokefteri on and she was in heaven. Please if you live anywhere nearby go here. You will love it!

Good service, the waiter and waitress are very friendly and caring. Mediterranean octopus salad, whole grill bronzini and a appetizer combo were what I ordered, they are all very delicious, just the fish a little bit too dry, my guess is the fish is not fresh(frozen fish), but overall is good. My husband ordered a steak, he loves it too."

First of all, my food was delivered within 21 minutes...And more impressively, the food was perfect. The seafood in the black linguine was fresh and a fair amount of everything. My steak (Athenian filet) was cooked to perfection, medium, and the sauce was very unique. I always order avgololemono from Greek restaurants to compare and this is at the top of my first for sure; good consistency, strong lemon taste but not overwhelming, orzo was cooked right and not too mushy like a lot of places. I can't wait to go through the rest of the menu and to eat in the restaurant."

My wife and I enjoy the food at Nicks. Yesterday, the service wasn't up to par. I had to wait minutes to be seated, even though when I arrived several tables for 2 were available. Once I sat down, no one came over to ask if we wanted anything. On the 2 other times that we had dinner at Nicks, the wait staff usually bring out a portion on hummus with pita bread to the table. We only received our hummus & pita bread after making a request. The patrons that came after us received their hummus & pita bread immediately. Our waiter took our order and basically that was the extend of our service until we requested the check. I left only a 10% tip, due to the fact I don't think that we had good service that night. I hope that this was just an anomaly and not the norm."

The set up made a great atmosphere.Our waiter, Kevin, was awesome! Personable yet professional.  Attentive to any glass half full and he even charged my phone for me(an odd request I am sure).After receiving complimentary hummus, beans, and pita for the table, we ordered the trio appetizer; Picked Calamari, stuffed shroom, and Cyprian sausage. The Calamari was fine. The shroom and sausage were fantastic.  The gyro platter was great. I even asked for an extra full pita and it came out fresh made very quickly.Two airline pilots that frequent Greek restaurants all the time, Rick's was aces!"

The food was delicious. The taste, although not as authentic as the real deal, it was pretty close. My boyfriend and I eat like animals so portion sizes are very important to us. We waddled out of Nick's Bistro with very full bellies. The service was amazing. Our water glasses were constantly being refilled before they ever reached the bottom. It was a bit chilly today so we sat indoors. I loved the fact that the music wasn't super loud. We were able to have a regular conversation. The outdoor seating looked very nice, so I'd love to come back on a warmer day to sit there.Defiantly a place I would recommend to my Greek friends and family."

Great Greek option in Forest Hills. We were seated right away and noticed how it was intimate and comfortable, not loud and obnoxious. Can definitely carry a normal conversation and have great food. They serve complimentary hummus and bean dip which was delicious and offer a variety of whole wheat and regular pita bread. We ordered the tzatziki and eggplant dip for $8.50 and keftda (meatballs) for appetizers. DELICIOUS. I highly recommend their dips - it also comes with the same variety of pita bread. Them meatballs....oh my goodness. So flavorful, very fresh and just a burst of Mediterranean goodness. Highly recommend the keftda. There's a total of 7 meatballs for this order so it's definitely a good sharing dish.I ordered the chicken souvlaki platter with a side of spinach rice (which was recommended to me over the pilaf) and it was great! It's a lot of food so it's a meal worth taking it to go so you can have this goodness for lunch the next day. The chicken was cut in chunks and grilled to perfection - not too dry and lots of flavor. I like spinach so the spinach rice was a great complement to the chicken. The platter comes with more pita bread, a bit of salad and an additional side salad (separate bowl). Overall, Nick's is now my go-to when I want Greek food in the area. The staff is very nice and attentive, and provide great service. Lots of different dishes to try and definitely interested in their brunch."

Came here last night for dinner. Before we entered we were warmly greeted and seated. First impression.. It's a nice cozy dimmed restaurant in a cute quiet neighborhood.Ordered a lamb and chicken platter with lemon potatoes and French fries. Before our food came we got a nice hummus platter with warm pita bread which was very tasty. When the food came..it looked amazing. I didn't take a picture since there's a lot of them on yelp as is. But Yes, everything was fresh and delicious. They serve a lot of meat which is good and very filling.  Oh and the french fries are out of this world! Crunchy and tasty. The lemon potatoes were soft and had a subtle lemon flavor. It came with a side salad which I thought  would have feta cheese in it but it was a regular side salad with a really good creamy balsamic vinaigrette. Overall the service here is excellent. The staff is very welcoming and superb. I would definitely come back if I'm in the area."

It's a small restaurant on Metropolitan with some fantastic food and service that's friendly but professional. It's a real treat to eat there in person because of the service and mellow vibe, but the food is so good that it's fine to have it delivered. The stuffed grape leaves-filled with meat, rice, and spices-are so good that we all crave them and order them in far too frequently. Their mussels in red sauce with feta travel surprisingly well and my 7-year-old son says they're the best thing he's ever eaten in his ""whole entire life."" The one thing that's excellent in the restaurant that doesn't seem to travel well is the gluten free pita, but that tends to be the nature of gluten free foods rather than a delivery issue. My only suggestion with delivery is to remind them to send your tzaziki and pita-they've been left out a couple of times and that's disappointing, particularly when you've ordered mussels and can't dunk pita in the sauce."

The shrimp was burned, but the vegetables were nicely fresh as was the calamari I ordered. It's okay, 3 stars."

The dessert was excellent Galaktoubrueko, definitely 5 stars for that. Perfect end to the meal cleaning our palate. The server was a charming young man who had a genuine interest in us as customers and in the food itself. He realized from our conversation that both my friend and I have a passion for food and after he knew how we enjoyed the dessert a nice surprise was to bring a piece each of baklava to try. Baklava was beautifully layered and not dipped in honey so could actually taste it. Better than that though was the chefs special cream whipped by his own hand. Very clean taste, light and fluffy. Main course large bronzini fish was nicely grilled and not swimming in fat. It was dry though but possibly because we had it butterflied. Starter octopus was delicious and after dessert our 2nd favorite item.  Mixed starter the chefs Greek sausage was short but thick and flavorsome, grilled and not fatty at all. The calamari was not to our liking and dry as indeed was the crab cake. For two of us the bill was over $120 so not cheap. I liked this place because of the company and the server but otherwise with so many places to try in NYC more to experience."

Delicious Greek food that even satisfies the taste buds of even the most picky diners. I dined here on a Saturday evening with a large group of friends for a birthday celebration. My group was seated promptly upon arrival and unfortunately, some of my guests decided tell me, literally, last minute that they wanted to show up... After speaking to the staff, they were actually understanding and accommodating to us. Thank you Alfred and staff!!!Food! Our group was presented with complimentary warm, grilled pitas with hummus and a fresh black eyed peas dip. I really enjoyed it! For appetizer, I ordered the Mediterranean Grilled Octopus. It was quite delicious! I loved that it was not greasy at all compared to others. Each piece was mouth sized, super tender, and slightly charred. It was bedded on a small salad. My neighboring guests and I really loved it. I really wish there was more!For entrees, I had a taste of the Chicken/Pork Souvlaki, Colorado Lamb Chops, and the Black Linguini. Souvlaki: Whether you get the chicken or pork souvlaki, you made a great choice! Souvlaki comes with many jumbo pieces of meat, grilled pitas (yes, again!), a side salad, and another side - lemon potatoes or rice. Each piece of meat was juicy and my knife was able to just slice into smaller pieces without much effort! It was nicely seasoned and tastes smokey! Must-order!Colorado Lamb Chops come with four beautifully grilled lamb chops and a side. They are very well seasoned with salt and spices. Not to mention, they were so tender and not gamey as I thought they would be. This quite a popular dish among the guys.Black Linguini. This pasta dish was pretty flavorful with all the fresh seafood in it - two jumbo prawns, scallops, mussels, and squid rings. I love the flavor of the seafood infused into the red sauce. I thought the portion of pasta was not enough. The black linguini was quite interesting and this is my second time having it. However, aside from its harder texture and color, I am actually not too sure what else is different from the normal linguini. This is something that I will research about!Sangria. Simply delicious. Obviously, very well made. Red wine was infused with the fresh fruits. It was so good that I just kept drinking and drinking... and it slowly creeped up on me. Before I even knew it, my face was as red as my drink!Service was phenomenal! Shout out to Alfred! I made reservations about a week prior using Yelp SeatMe. I asked for tables on the right side of the restaurant with the benches. I sincerely appreciate a phone call that I got from Alfred who simply wants to clarify which part of the restaurant I meant. I liked that he just simply asked me rather than just assuming. Thank you very much for being so accommodating!!!"

What really caught my attention was that they accommodated my very annoying request that was placed in comments. I'm an extremely indecisive person and can never choose what accompanying side I want. I placed a request asking for a half portion of rice pilaf, and a half portion of lemon potatoes and they brought my order exactly as requested.

Get the meat stuffed grape leaves as an appetizer. Best I've ever eaten. Octopus was tender and moist with a nice char. Keftedes were tasty balls of goodness. Two different shrimp dishes were cooked perfectly. While the crab stuffed shrimp was excellent the geek style in a tomato and feta sauce were outstanding.  . All fishes were expertly cooked. Desserts were 4-1/2 star worthy.  Would definitely return.

Very nice, but I feel bad, because they really should be paid for it. Either way, I'm going to order again, and if they still don't have the tzatziki on the menu, I'm going to have to just place my order over the phone.

The drink (rum punch) I ordered tasted so watered down that I had to send it back. I ordered the lobster roll special and specifically asked for no bacon as I am highly allergic. Food took forever and when it came and I took my first bite, what did I taste? A mouthful of bacon. Ugh. Hope I don't have to pay for that later at a doctor's office! Had to send that back too. There were a bunch of different waiters moving around so I barely got the same person throughout the night. When the new order came out the waitress that took the original order barely mumbled a sorry and just placed the plate in front of me. Apparently she was more mad than me. I never saw her again the rest of the night. My husband did enjoy his shrimp dish and when the lobster came right the second time, it was good but a smaller portion than the original serving. Different waiter came to clear our plates and take dessert order. They didn't have what I wanted (cheesecake baklava) so we settled for just the baklava. It was good. The bill came and of course nothing was comped for the mistake. Infact, the drink I sent back was still on there. Waiter took a good 10-15 mins to reappear at which point I asked him to have the rum punch removed. It was and we paid and left. The food was good but not worth the hassle (with no proper apology) so we wouldn't be returning."

Nick's is certainly a gem of a restaurant for upscale Greek in the Kew Gardens-Forest Hills area. With an eclectic mix of Italian and American dishes, you won't get the authenticity of the establishments in Astoria, the Greek epicenter of Queens, but you will certainly be treated to a good meal, service, and ambiance. I don't mind the diversity of the menu because the setting is nice, and having the option of eating chicken wings or a mozzarella sticks in addition to the Greek fare is nice. The Mediterranean spreads  are OK here, but I would recommend skipping them and opting for a meat or seafood appetizer instead. The keftedes are delicious, but we tried some Greek sausages that were a part of the night's specials, which were full of flavor, tender, and absolutely delicious. When it comes to entrees, Nick's portions are huge, and lamb served in a variety of ways is what I like most. The lamb chops, loin, shank, and kebabs are all superb: crispy and slightly charred on the outside and delightfully juicy and tender on the inside. The Colorado lamb chops are a must have, and if you're lucky enough to snag an order of the lamb shank that is often offered a special, it's an absolute must! A really nice neighborhood place that is upscale enough for a nice night out, and reasonably priced enough for a quick meal if you're in the mood for Greek."

My boyfriend ordered a lamb gyro and loved it except they toasted pita bread to long. Didn't say anything about it. I had a stuffed flounder with spinach and feta with salad on side. I think a Greek restaurant would put some feta or kalamata olives in but no. Fine no problem. Didn't say anything. Food was actually very good. We ordered shots of tequila. 2 each. No problem. Asked for the check and gave waitress my debit card. Anyways she comes back and said had to void it because her and her boss (I guess) added 2 extra drinks. Honestly wouldn't have bothered me if she just told me. Would have taken the 2 shots. But to charge twice and void once without telling me is bad. Could have messed me up with my bank. Just give people a heads up before you charge and void. Anyways I feel bad because up until the checks came had a lovely time. I understand there was good intentions just a bad way to end a good lunch.

I ordered the stuffed zucchini special which was described as ""how grandma made it""; a gigantic zucchini stuffed with spiced meats and rice with a side of lemon mashed potatoes. A got the Nick's burger. I also ordered a glass of Sauvignon Blanc, which was pretty good. Good wines by the glass  surprise me as many places sell subpar wine that's been open too long so it's flat and sour. Not so here! Minutes into our meal, our pups decided they've had it with waiting under the table for us and started howling and pulling at their leash (anyone know of a good obedience school?). Plus, the nice afternoon turned into a chilly, breezy evening and we were freezing! No wonder no one sat outside! I went to the bathroom and the inside was very warm and cozy. So we asked for them to wrap our meal to go and they again accommodated us very nicely and quickly. Good food, good service; we'll be back petless to have a full meal here again soon!"

This place has a very cozy and intimate atmosphere. The servers are very attentive, and make sure you're always catered to.The food is great. They start you off with some pita bread and hummus. I have tried a wide range of dishes here from the lemon ouzo chicken to the crab meat stuffed salmon (my boyfriends favorite dish) and they've all been great. Now my absolutely favorite thing from here is the Greek Cannoli. It's basically a caramel coated waffle cone with sort of a cheese cake ice cream filling (you MUST try it )"

Thank God we did! Food is amazing, drinks were delicious! Wait staff was on point, extremely friendly and knowable about thier food. I'm a Seafood lover so we start of with their Stuffed Mushrooms (stuffed with real crab meat, you can actually see chunks of crab meat) and Grilled Octopus. Best Octopus I ever had! Later on I had Thalassini Fotia (huge plate with a lot of spicy Seafood and linguni). My date tried their Lamb Shank Uvetsi from special menu. He was thrilled. Meat was so tender and full of flavor!If you have room left for dessert please go with Mama's homemade Brownies. Delicious!!Definitely will be back!!!"

One of our favorite places to eat in queens. I'm getting the shrimp cocktail and the Athenian Filet (sliced filet mignon in a brown feta cheese sauce.). I usually get their fabulous Black Linguini w/ shrimp, mussels, clams in a delicious tomato sauce - but this evening I'm trying something new.  My hubby is getting his usual favorite: Lemon Ouzo Chicken.  He loves that! I love the hummus w/ black eyed peas & pita that they put on the table as you peruse the menu.The Athenian Filet was an excellent choice! The filet mignon was cooked exactly as I ordered it and who knew feta & steak paired so well together!!  Delicious! As I stated in my previous review, the servers are very attentive, informative & welcoming.   They've been working here quite a few years - Alfred, one of the partners is a very nice guy & I'm sure he's an excellent boss!! They're busy as they usually are & Alfred is checking on customers, pouring water --- very involved !"

The place was completely empty, but we decided to give it a try. Service was excellent, but the real winner here is the food. I had the steak salad which we DELICIOUS with blue cheese and candied nuts. Also, the wines are $6, so I ordered their Pinot Noir and it was delicious. I look forward to coming back and trying more of their delicious food. Oh, and after we sat the place filled up quick, so it's definitely a known place to eat at for good food."

We ordered the grilled octopus, lemon potatoes and the chicken souvlaki platter. The octopus was a bit chewy which we know that means it's not fresh the potatoes were good the chicken on the souvlaki platter was basic grilled chicken nothing special. The food was just okay the place was just okay what can I say I wouldn't go back."

The waiter was so clumsy and didn't even understand the first thing about being a waiter. He spilled ice cold water all over me and the staff decided it was best just to give us a new waiter- fine. If you make such a stupid and amateur mistake, wouldn't you guys agree they should give me something on the house or comp something off our bill? Nope! I paid $80 for what was the worst food ever. The scallops tasted like they died before they were caught and the food was either under seasoned or over seasoned. THE WORST EXPERIENCE EVER. Don't eat here unless you want water spilled on you and management doesn't want to be responsibile. What a joke."

The food and service are stellar and for size of portions and quality of preparation they are a great value. I have been there MANY times and everything I've ordered has been excellent. Their Grilled Salmon over Greek Salad for lunch is an incredible value at about $14. At dinner their grilled meats chicken and fish cannot  be beat and the Greek specialties are all tasty and interesting. ( Cyprian sausage ! ) The outdoor seating area - is IMO- the best place to enjoy their excellent food - what's better than sitting outdoors on a beautiful evening with great food and a glass of wine, being taken care of by friendly and professional staff !"

I've had Nick's bookmarked for a while and was able to cross it off my list on a random Saturday afternoon for brunch. It was around 2:30 in the afternoon and there were only a handful of tables occupied, however, that quickly changed a few minutes later. We were greeted and seated to a table for 2 and offered drinks to start. For our brunch items, we opted for the octopus salad and the gyro platter. Both were delicious and were served in generous portions. The octopus was grilled and tender, which complemented the greens nicely. The salad was served tossed in dressing, which was just right. The gyro platter was served with pita bread and tzatziki on the side and was more delicious than I could remember. We left satisfied and full and were pleased with both the service and food.Great job, Nick's!"

My girlfriend and I went to dinner here last night. The restaurant was not crowded and just to play it safe I made a reservation earlier in the week. We were seated promptly. The waiter came over to take our drink order and asked if we were ready to order our meal which we were not yet ready to order yet. He came over a few minutes later and we gave him our order which consisted of a salad we were going to share before our main meal and our dinner. As we were eating our salad , the busboy brings out the side dishes to our main meal!!  I told him to take it away as we were still eating our salad! We finish our salad and they take away our plates and bring us our dinner. Needless to say my girlfriend's steak was cold and my side dish was cold as well. We asked to have each dish heated. I do not understand why we were rushed as the restaurant was not crowded and at the same time, it is a Saturday night out and we shouldn't have felt as though we are being kicked out so the next set of diners of which there were none can be seated."

What was a bit disappointing was that we had made 7:30 reservations through Yelp and yet we had to wait 1/2 hr to be seated. Let's be honest those reservations were absolutely useless because that's the length of time we would've had to wait had we just walked up and into the restaurant. I mentioned this to the hostess and her reply was ""well we can never tell when there'll be a table available, it happens."" So what is the point of accepting reservations then, If your process is to seat everyone who walks into the restaurant on a first come first serve basis? It seems like this restaurant needs to reevaluate their reservation process. And if you ask no, we were not offered even a drink or coffee or dessert on the house which most places would've done."

The crab stuffing was so good that my boyfriend ordered his all time favorite: salmon with crab stuffing and grilled vegetables.  Absolutely well-cooked, crispy outside and tender pink inside.  The grilled vegetables are so grilled that you can see the dark grill marks, making this an ultimate side dish.  We also had the strozzapreti with grilled zucchini and feta and I must say, this is probably one of the best pasta dishes I've had.  Chunks of feta and grilled veggies are a nice touch to their beautifully cooked strozzapreti with red sauce.  The service is absolutely stellar, always refilling water glasses and checking up on you.  Seating is not really an issue but keep in mind - there are a lot of regulars, so if you have to wait, it is worth the wait!"

So insanely bitter that we couldn't choke them down even with pita and salad to soften the blow. Honestly seemed like someone had accidentally tipped an entire container of cumin (which I happen to love) or something of the sort into the mix by accident and decided to make them anyway. When the side of rice and complimentary hummus served when you sit down are the highlights of the meal you know something has gone seriously awry.

They have wonderful reviews and outdoor seating. Although we actually didn't stay outside for our dinner. I am not sure if they have valet parking but you definitely have look for your parking. We were at the restaurant around 7.15 and it wasn't too bad but around 8 pm, people started to flock to this place.    We were super hungry when we got this place and we devoured everything. My taste buds were in over stimulation that I am too sure about how well my review be considered.  When we sat down the service was friendly and quick. We had our drinks and got some pita with hummus and olives. They were all wonderful. I kinda made a tiny pig outta myself but eat way too much of that pita. The hummus is average, it didn't spark my pallet into wonder lust.   I ordered the lobster ravioli because it was pasta and I was starving. Everyone else had the chicken kabobs with rice. We also ordered fries and they were delicious. Of course it is fries and we were all so hungry. So they tasted marvelous. The lobster ravioli was not particular good. It was kinda of weird because the pasta was ""grilled"". I am not sure if that's the exact term but that's what it looked like. The dish can be more favor full. It was mundane. Regardless, I will go back and try them because the place is clean, affordable and friendly."

Last time I went & we ordered a Kobe beef burger that was incredibly dry. We also got the regular burger with sautéed mushrooms and the mushrooms were cooked to the point it tasted bitter.I love the look and feel of nicks. It's really a nice restaurant with live music on some nights. The out door seating is very cute. I just wish their food wasn't so dry or bitter or over cooked all the time. It just lacks serious flavor in my opinion.

Since I have such a sweet tooth, the baklava is my FAVORITE thing ever! But the food at Nick's is truly amazing. Their chicken souvlaki, the chicken gyro, the hummus with pita chips, the lemon potatoes...everything!"

Really? In the ""crabmeat"" stuffed jumbo shrimp?  Not good to find. Shrimp were good though. Grilled octopus appetizer is good. Not great. Avgolemeno soup is ok. No Greek wine by the glass? Why?  Gin and tonic was yellowed? It's our ""weird tonic""'the waiter says. Chicken spanaki has too much creamed sauce on top and the sauce was cold. Stuffing of spinach and feta was very flavorful though. And lastly, the clientele..... Maybe just tonight but older folks with poor eating habits and poorer table manners.  Been here before but still not a fan. Astoria is so close will find better Greek elsewhere."

Fresh everything, the salad was amazing the sandwich was perfect fries were seasoned amazing. Waitstaff was beyond our expectations. If you don't eat here and have a bad experience somewhere else consider yourself warned you missed out."

My family has tried every Greek delivery available and this is the only one we feel satisfied after. Between the execution and the abundance of food, we couldn't be happier with the results! Fun fact: it's the only restaurant we have never physically eaten in, not that the location is bad, it's beautiful and close to another favorite - Eddies Ice Cream Parlour. This is just our habit! Lol enjoy!"

I don't think I ever reviewed them on Yelp.  Silly me! I have had many meals at this fantastic restaurant and have never eaten anything I did not like. We have had several family birthday dinners there, as well as impromptu get-togethers with friends and family. Several weeks ago, my sister and I went there on a weeknight for drinks and appetizers. (I still have not gone on a Tuesday, when they have live music. I have to fit that into my schedule.) I pride myself on trying new dishes when I go out to eat, and Nick's always has something interesting on the menu for me to try! Tonight, after a rough day at work, I didn't go too far off of the beaten path, but instead enjoyed ""comfort food."" One of my favorite appetizers is their crab cakes, and tonight they offered crab cake fritters. I had to try them, and they did not disappoint! For my main dish, I was drawn to their fresh fish menu (what a great selection... I asked the waiter for a recommendation.) I decided on the filet of sole stuffed with their flavorful crabmeat stuffing.  I have had their crabmeat stuffing in the past - with a shrimp dish - and it was just as delicious as I remembered. The stuffing is fluffy and fresh, and full of flavor. (Never dry or crusty like other places I have dined.) The fish was fresh... the grilled veggies on the side were fresh... and I had a glass of wine to compliment the food.  By the way... in the past, I have also tried their stuffed mushrooms (my second favorite menu item) as well as their spinach pie, mozzarella sticks, onion rings, steak, duck, lamb chops, chicken, shrimp, and one other fish dish - the entire whole fish was served on a platter. That was an interesting meal! (By the way - I don't usually like duck, but my fiance ordered it once when we went to dinner at Nick's and insisted I try a bite.... it changed my mind about duck!) In summary, you can never go wrong when you enjoy a meal at Nick's Bistro. It has a great atmosphere, the staff is always friendly and polite, and we always end up socializing with the folks at neighboring tables because it is such a wonderfully inviting place. If I could give them ten stars... I would!"
